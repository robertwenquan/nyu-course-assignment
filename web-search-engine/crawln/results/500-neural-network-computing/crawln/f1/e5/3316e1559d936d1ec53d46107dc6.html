<p itemprop="articleBody"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t was probably the worst prediction in
history. Back in the 1940s, Thomas Watson, boss of the giant IBM Corporation, reputedly forecast
that the world would need no more than "about five computers." Six decades later and
the global population of computers has now risen to something like one billion machines!</p>

<p>To be fair to Watson, computers have changed enormously in that time. In the 1940s, they were giant
scientific and military behemoths commissioned by the government at a
cost of millions of dollars apiece; today, most computers are not even
recognizable as such: they are embedded in everything from <a
 href="microwaveovens.html">microwave ovens</a> to <a
 href="cellphones.html">cellphones</a> and <a href="radio.html">digital
radios</a>. What makes computers flexible enough to work in all these
different appliances? How come they are so phenomenally useful? And how
exactly do they work? Let's take a closer look!</p>

<h2>What is a computer?</h2>
<P><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/microchip-on-finger.jpg" class="ileftno" width=300 height=225 ALT="Microchip on a fingertip"></P>
<p>
A computer is an <a href="electronics.html">electronic</A> machine that processes information&mdash;in other
words, an <span class="bold">information processor</span>: it takes in
raw information (or <span class="bold">data</span>) at one end, stores it until it's
ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end.
All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called <span
 class="bold">input</span>, storing information is better known as <span class="bold">memory</span> (or storage),
chewing information is also known as <span class="bold">processing</span>, and
spitting out results is called <span class="bold">output</span>.</P>

<P><span class="credit">Photo: Computers that used to take up a huge room now fit comfortably on your finger!.</span></P>


<p>Imagine if a computer were a person. Suppose you have a friend who's
really good at math. She is so good that everyone she knows posts their math problems to
her.&nbsp; Each morning, she goes to her letterbox and finds a pile of
new math problems waiting for her attention. She piles them up on her
desk until she
gets around to looking at them. Each afternoon, she takes a letter off
the top of the pile, studies the problem, works out the
solution, and scribbles the answer on the back. She puts
this in an envelope addressed to the person who sent her the original
problem and sticks it in her out tray, ready to post. Then she moves to
the next letter in the pile. You can see that your friend is working
just like a computer. Her letterbox is her input; the pile on her desk
is her memory; her brain is the processor that works out the solutions
to the problems; and the out tray on her desk is her output.</p>
<p>Once you understand that computers are about input, memory, processing, and output, all the junk on your desk makes a lot more sense:</P>
<P><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/how-computer-works.png" width=400 height=260 class="iright" ALT="How computers work: Simple line artwork explaining the structure of a computer system, showing how a computer links input, output, storage/memory, and processing"></P>

another form of input.</LI>

<h2>What is a computer program?</h2>

<p>
As you can read in our long article on <a
 href="historyofcomputers.html">computer history</a>, the first
computers were gigantic <a href="calculators.html">calculating machines</A> and all they ever really
did was "crunch numbers": solve lengthy, difficult, or tedious
mathematical problems. Today, computers work on a much wider variety of
problems&mdash;but they are all still, essentially, calculations. Everything
a computer does, from helping you to edit a photograph you've taken
with a digital camera to displaying
a web page, involves manipulating numbers in one way or another.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/lcd-calculator.display.jpg" class="ileftno" height="225" width="300" ALT="LCD calculator screen"></p>


<p>
Suppose you're looking at a digital photo you just taken in a paint or
photo-editing program and you decide you want a mirror image of it (in
other words, flip it
from left to right). You probably know that the photo is made up of
millions of individual pixels (colored squares) arranged in a grid
pattern. The computer stores each pixel as a number, so taking a
digital
photo is really like an instant, orderly exercise in painting by
numbers! To flip a digital photo, the computer simply reverses the
sequence of numbers so they run from right to left instead of left to
right. Or suppose you want to make the photograph brighter. All you
have
to do is slide the little "brightness" icon. The computer then works
through all the pixels, increasing the brightness value for each one
by, say, 10 percent to make the entire image brighter. So, once again,
the problem boils down to numbers and calculations.</p>

<p>
What makes a computer different from a <a href="calculators.html">calculator</A> is that it can work
all by itself. You just give it your instructions (called a <span
 class="bold">program</span>)
and off it goes, performing a long and complex series of operations all
by itself. Back in the 1970s and 1980s, if you wanted a home computer
to do almost anything at all, you had to write your own little program
to do it. For example, before you could write a letter on a computer,
you had to write a program that would read the letters you typed on the
keyboard, store them in the memory, and display them on the screen.
Writing the program usually took more time than doing whatever it
was that you had originally wanted to do (writing the letter). Pretty
soon, people started selling programs like word processors to save you
the need to write programs yourself.</p>
<p>
Today, most computer users buy, download, or share programs like
Microsoft Word and Excel. Hardly anyone writes programs any more. Most
people see their computers as tools that help them do jobs, rather than
complex electronic machines they have to pre-program&mdash;and that's just as
well, because most of us have better things to do than computer
programming.</p>

<P><span class="credit">Photo: Calculators and computers are very similar, because both work by processing numbers. However, a calculator simply figures out the results of calculations; and that's all it ever does. A computer stores complex sets of instructions called programs and uses them to do much more interesting things.</span></P>

<h2>What's the difference between hardware and software?</h2>
<p>
The beauty of a computer is that it can run a word-processing program one
minute&mdash;and then a photo-editing program five seconds later. In other
words, although we
don't really think of it this way, the computer can be reprogrammed as
many times as you like. This is why programs are also called <span
 class="bold">software</span>.
They're "soft" in the sense that they are not fixed: they can be
changed easily. By contrast, a computer's <span class="bold">hardware</span>&mdash;the
bits and
pieces from which it is made (and the <span class="bold">peripherals</span>,
like the mouse and printer, you plug into it)&mdash;is pretty much fixed when you buy
it off the shelf. The hardware is what makes your computer powerful;
the ability to run different software is what makes it flexible. That
computers can do so many different jobs is what makes them so useful<span
 class="bold"></span>&mdash;and that's why millions of us can no longer live
without them!
</P>

<h2>What is an operating system?</h2>
<P>
Suppose you're back in the late 1970s, before off-the-shelf computer programs have really been invented.
You want to program your computer to work as a word processor so you can bash out your first novel&mdash;which is relatively easy but will take
you a few days of work. A few weeks later, you tire of writing things and decide to reprogram your machine
so it'll play chess. Later still, you decide to program it to store your photo collection. Every one of
these programs does different things, but they also do quite a lot of similar things too. For example,
they all need to be able to read the keys pressed down on the keyboard, store things in memory and retrieve them, and
display characters (or pictures) on the screen. If you were writing lots of different programs, you'd find yourself
writing the same bits of programming to do these same basic operations every time. That's a bit
of a programming chore, so why not simply collect together all the bits of program that do these basic
functions and reuse them each time?</P>

<P><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/computer-architecture.jpg" class="ileft" width=282 height=322 ALT="A typical computer architecture linking the hardware to the applications via the BIOS and the operating system."></P>

<P>That's the basic idea behind an <span class="bold">operating system</span>: it's the core software in a computer that (essentially) controls the basic chores of input, output, storage, and processing.
You can think of an operating system as the "foundations" of the software in a computer that other programs (called <span class="bold">applications</span>) are built on top of. So a word processor and a chess game are two different applications that both rely on the operating system to carry out their basic input, output, and so on. The operating system relies on an even more fundamental piece of programming called the <span class="bold">BIOS (Basic Input Output System)</span>, which is the link between the operating system software and the hardware. Unlike the operating system, which is the same from one computer to another, the BIOS does vary from machine to machine according to the precise hardware configuration and is usually written by the hardware manufacturer.
The BIOS is not, strictly speaking, <span class="italic">software</span>: it's a program semi-permanently stored into
one of the computer's main chips, so it's known as <span class="bold">firmware</span>
(it is usually designed so it can be updated occasionally, however).</P>

<P>
<span class="credit">Photo: Typical computer architecture: You can think of a computer as a series of layers, with the hardware at
the bottom, the BIOS connecting the hardware to the operating system, and the applications you actually use (such as word processors,
Web browsers, and so on) running on top of that. Each of these layers is relatively independent so, for example, the same Windows operating system might run on laptops running a different BIOS, while a computer running Windows (or another operating system) can run any number of different applications.</span>
</P>


<P>
Operating systems have another big benefit. Back in the 1970s (and early 1980s), virtually all computers were maddeningly different. They all ran in their own, idiosyncratic ways with fairly unique hardware (different processor chips, memory addresses, screen sizes and all the rest). Programs written for one machine (such as an Apple) usually wouldn't run on any other machine (such as an IBM) without quite extensive conversion. That was a big problem for programmers because it meant they had to rewrite all their programs each time they wanted to run them on different machines. How did operating systems help? If you have a standard operating system and you tweak it so it will work on any machine, all you have to do is write applications that work on the operating system. Then any application will work on any machine. The operating system that definitively made this breakthrough was, of course, Microsoft Windows, written by Bill Gates. (It's important to note that there were earlier operating systems too. You can read more of that story in our article on the <a href="historyofcomputers.html">history of computers</A>.)</P>

<h2>Computers for everyone?</h2>
<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/laptop-handside.jpg" class="irightno" height="244" width="300" ALT="Green OLPC laptop"></p>

<p>What should we do about the <span class="bold">digital divide</span>&mdash;the gap between people who use computers
and those who don't? Most people have chosen just to ignore it, but US computer pioneer Nicholas Negroponte and his
team have taken a much more practical approach. Over the last few
years, they've worked to create a trimmed-down, low-cost laptop
suitable for people who live in developing countries where <a href="electricity.html">electricity</a>
and <a href="telephone.html">telephone</A> access are harder to find. Their project is known as OLPC: One Laptop Per Child.</p>

<p><span class="credit">Photo: courtesy of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.laptop.org/">One Laptop Per Child</a>, licensed under a <a target="_blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">Creative Commons License</a>.</span>
</p>

<h3>What's different about the OLPC?</h3>

<p>In essence, OLPC is no different from any other laptop: it's a
machine with input, output, memory storage, and a processor&mdash;the key components of
any computer. But in OLPC, these parts have been designed especially
for developing countries. </p>

<p>Here are some of the key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low cost: OLPC is designed to cost just $100&mdash;much less than a
traditional laptop.</li>
<li>Inexpensive <a href="lcdtv.html">LCD</A> screen: The hi-tech screen is designed to work
outdoors in bright sunlight, but costs only $35 to make&mdash;a fraction of
the cost of a normal LCD flat panel display.</li>
<li>Trimmed down operating system: The operating system is like the
conductor of an orchestra: the part of a computer that makes all the
other parts (from the processor chip to the buttons on the mouse) work
in harmony. OLPC uses <a href="linux.html">Linux</a> (an efficient and
low-cost operating system
developed by thousands of volunteers) instead of the more expensive
Windows system.</li>
<li>Wireless <a href="howbroadbandworks.html">broadband</a>: In some
parts of Africa, fewer than one
person in a hundred has access to a wired, landline telephone, so
dialup Internet access via telephone would be no use for OLPC users.
Each machine's wireless chip will allow it to create an ad-hoc 
<a href="howcomputernetworkswork.html">network</A>
with other machines nearby&mdash;so OLPC users will be able to talk to
one another and exchange information effortlessly.</li>
<li><a href="flashmemory.html">Flash memory</a>: Instead of an
expensive and relatively unreliable
<a href="harddrive.html">hard drive</a>, OLPC uses a huge lump of
flash memory&mdash;like the memory used
in <a href="usb.html">USB</A> flash memory sticks and <a href="digitalcameras.html">digital
camera</a> memory cards.</li>
<li>Own power: Home electricity supplies are scarce in many
developing countries, so OLPC has a hand <a href="cranks-and-cams.html">crank</a> and built-in
<a href="generators.html">generator</A>.
One minute of cranking generates up to 10 minutes of power.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Is OLPC a good idea?</h3>

<p>Anything that closes the digital divide, helping poorer children
gain access to education and opportunity, must be a good thing.
However, some critics have questioned whether projects like this are
really meeting the most immediate needs of people in developing
countries. According to the World Health Organization, around 1.1
billion people (18 percent of the world's population) have no access to
safe drinking <a href="water.html">water</A>, while 2.7 billion (a staggering 42 percent of the
world's population) lack basic sanitation. During the 1990s, around 2
billion people were affected by major natural disasters such as floods
and droughts. Every single day, 5000 children die because of dirty
water&mdash;that's more people dying <span class="italic">each day</span> than were killed in the
9/11 terrorist attacks.</p>

<p>With basic problems on this scale, it could be argued that providing
access to computers and the Internet is not a high priority for most of
the world's poorer people. Then again, education is one of the most
important weapons in the fight against poverty. Perhaps computers could
provide young people with the knowledge they need to help themselves, their
families, and communities escape a life sentence of hardship?</p>

website; if you're interested in the broader issue of extending access to computers, the <a href="http://www.digitaldivide.net/" target="_blank">Digital Divide Network</a> is a good place to start
