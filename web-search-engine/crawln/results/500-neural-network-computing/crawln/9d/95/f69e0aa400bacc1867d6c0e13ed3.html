<p itemprop="articleBody"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ave you ever heard of a 1940s <a href="howcomputerswork.html">computer</a>
called the ENIAC? It was about the same length and weight as three to four double-decker buses and
contained 18,000 buzzing electronic switches known as vacuum tubes.
Despite its gargantuan size, it was <a target="_blank"
 href="http://www.toshiba-europe.com/computers/sna/tnt/visions97/feniac.htm">thousands
of times less powerful</a> than a
modern laptop&#8212;a machine about 100 times smaller.</P>

<P>If the  <a href="historyofcomputers.html">history of computing</a> sounds like a magic trick&mdash;squeezing more and more power
into less and less space&mdash;it is! What made it
possible was the invention of the <B>integrated
circuit (IC)</B> in 1958. It's a neat way of cramming hundreds, thousands, millions, or
even billions of <a href="electronics.html">electronic</a> components
onto tiny chips of silicon no
bigger than a fingernail. Let's take a closer look at ICs and how
they work!</p>

<p><span class="credit">Photo: An integrated circuit from the outside. This is what an IC looks like when it's conveniently packaged inside a <a href="flashmemory.html" target="_blank">flash memory</A> chip. Inside the black protective case, there's a tiny integrated circuit, with millions of transistors capable of storing millions of binary digits of information. You can see what the circuit itself looks like in the photograph below.
</span></p>

<h2>What is an integrated circuit?</h2>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/integratedcircuitnasa.jpg" class="irightno" height="288" width="327" ALT="Inside a typical microchip. You can see the  integrated circuit and the wires that connect to the terminals around its edge."></p>


<p>Open up a <a href="television.html">television</a> or a <a
 href="radio.html">radio</a> and you'll see it's built around a 
<B>printed circuit board (PCB)</B>: a bit like an electric street-map with
small <a href="electronics.html">electronic</a>
components (such as <a href="resistors.html">resistors</a> and <a href="capacitors.html">capacitors</a>)
in place of
the buildings and printed <a href="copper.html">copper</a> connections
linking them together
like miniature metal streets. Circuit boards are fine in small
appliances like this, but if you try to use the same technique to
build a complex electronic machine, such as a <a href="howcomputerswork.html">computer</A>, you quickly
hit a snag. Even the simplest computer needs eight electronic
switches to store a single byte (character) of information. So if you
want to build a computer with just enough memory to store this
paragraph, you're looking at about 750 characters times 8 or about
6000 switches&#8212;for a <span class="italic">single paragraph</span>! If
you plump for
switches like they had in the ENIAC&#8212;vacuum tubes about the size of
an adult thumb&#8212;you soon end up with a whopping great big,
power-hungry machine that needs its own mini <a href="powerplants.html">electricity
plant</a> to
keep it running.</p>


<p><span class="credit">Photo: An integrated circuit from the inside. If you could lift the cover off a typical microchip like the one in the top photo (and you can't very easily&mdash;believe me, I've tried!), this is what you'd find inside. The integrated circuit is the tiny square in the center. Connections run out from it to the terminals (metal pins or legs) around the edge. When you hook up something to one of these terminals, you're actually connecting into the circuit itself. You can just about see the pattern of electronic components on the surface of the chip itself.

<p>When three American physicists invented <a href="howtransistorswork.html">transistors</a>  in 1947, things
improved somewhat. Transistors were a fraction the size of vacuum tubes and <a
 href="howrelayswork.html">relays</a>
(the electromagnetic switches that had started to replace vacuum tubes in
the mid-1940s), used much less power, and were far more reliable. But
there was still the problem of linking all those transistors
together in complex circuits. Even after transistors were invented,
computers were still a tangled mass of wires.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/fettransistor.jpg" class="ileftno" height="240" width="300" ALT="A FET transistor on a printed circuit board."></p>

<p>Integrated circuits changed all that. The basic idea was to take a
complete circuit, with all its many components and the connections between
them, and recreate the whole thing in microscopically tiny form on the surface of a
piece of silicon. It was an amazingly clever idea and it's made
possible all kinds of "microelectronic" gadgets we now take for
granted, from digital <a href="quartzclockwatch.html">watches</a> and
pocket <a href="calculators.html">calculators</a> to Moon-landing
<a href="spacerockets.html">rockets</a> and missiles with built-in <a
 href="howgpsworks.html">satellite navigation</a>.</p>

<p><span class="credit">Photo: A typical modern transistor mounted on a printed circuit board. Imagine having to wire hundreds of millions of these things onto a PCB!</span></p>


<h2>How are integrated circuits made?</h2>

<P>How do we make something like a memory or processor chip for a computer? It all starts with a raw chemical element such as silicon, which is chemically treated or doped to make it have different electrical properties...</P>

<h3>Doping semiconductors</h3>
<p>If you've read our articles on <a href="diodes.html">diodes</a> and
<a href="howtransistorswork.html">transistors</a>, you'll be
familiar with the idea of <B>semiconductors</B>.
Traditionally, people thought of materials fitting into two neat categories: those
that allow <a href="electricity.html">electricity</a> to flow through
them quite readily (conductors) and those that don't (insulators).
<a href="introduction-to-metals.html">Metals</A> make up most of the conductors, while nonmetals such as
<a href="plastics.html">plastics</A>, <a href="wood.html">wood</A>, and <a href="glass.html">glass</A>
are the insulators. In fact, things are far more complex than this&#8212;especially when it comes to certain
elements in the middle of the periodic table (in groups 14 and 15), notably silicon and
germanium. Normally insulators, these elements can be
made to behave more like conductors if we add small quantities of
impurities to them in a process known as <B>doping</B>.
If you add antimony to silicon, you give it slightly more electrons than it
would normally have&#8212;and the power to conduct electricity. Silicon
"doped" that way is called <B>n-type</B>. Add boron instead of antimony
and you remove some of silicon's electrons, leaving behind "holes"
that work as "negative electrons," carrying a positive electric
current in the opposite way. That kind of silicon is called <B>p-type</B>.
Putting areas of n-type and p-type silicon side by side creates
junctions where electrons behave in very interesting ways&#8212;and that's
how we create electronic, semiconductor-based components like diodes,
transistors, and <a href="how-computer-memory-works.html">memories</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/circuitboardtracks.jpg" class="irightno" height="218" width="300" ALT="Printed circuit board tracks"></p>

<p><span class="credit">Photo: A traditional printed circuit board (PCB) like this has tracks linking together the terminals (metal connecting legs) from different electronic components. Think of the tracks as "streets" making paths between "buildings" where useful things are done (the components themselves). There's a miniaturized version of a circuit board inside an integrated circuit: the tracks are created in microscopic form on the surface of a silicon wafer. This is the reverse side of the flash memory chip in our top photo.</span></p>

<h3>Inside a chip plant</h3>
<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/siliconwafer.jpg" class="ileftno" height="292" width="250" ALT="A silicon wafer"></p>

<p>The process of making an integrated circuit starts off with a big
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_crystal" target="_blank">single crystal</A> of silicon, shaped like a long solid pipe, which is "salami sliced" into thin discs
(about the dimensions of a compact disc) called <B>wafers</B>.
The wafers are marked out into many identical square or rectangular areas, each
of which will make up a single silicon chip (sometimes called a
microchip). Thousands, millions, or billions of components are then
created on each chip by doping different areas of the surface to turn them into
n-type or p-type silicon. Doping is done by a variety of different
processes. In one of them, known as <B>sputtering</B>,
ions of the doping material are fired at the silicon wafer like bullets from a
gun. Another process called <B>vapor deposition</B>
involves introducing the doping material as a gas and letting it condense so
the impurity atoms create a thin film on the surface of the silicon
wafer. <a href="molecular-beam-epitaxy-introduction.html">Molecular beam epitaxy</a>
is a much more precise form of deposition.</p>

<p><span class="credit">Photo: A silicon wafer. Photo by courtesy of NASA Glenn Research Center (NASA-GRC).</span></p>


<p>Of course, making integrated circuits that pack hundreds, millions,
or billions of components onto a fingernail-sized chip of silicon is all
a bit more complex and involved than it sounds. Imagine the havoc
even a speck of dirt could cause when you're working at the
<a href="microscopes.html">microscopic</a> (or sometimes even the <a href="nanotechnologyforkids.html">nanoscopic</a>)
scale. That's why semiconductors are made in spotless laboratory environments called
<B>clean rooms</B>, where the air is meticulously
filtered and
workers have to pass in and out through airlocks wearing all kinds of
protective clothing.</p>

<h2>Who invented the integrated circuit?</h2>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/assortedmicrochips.jpg" class="ileftno" height="240" width="300" ALT="Assorted computer microchips on a table"></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou've probably read in books that ICs were developed jointly by
<B>Jack Kilby</B> (1923&ndash;2005) and
<B>Robert Noyce</B> (1927&ndash;1990), as though these two men
happily collaborated on their brilliant invention! In fact, Kilby and Noyce
came up with the idea independently, at more or less exactly the same
time, prompting a furious battle for the rights to the invention that
was anything but happy.</p>


<p><span class="credit">Photo: Computer microchips like these&mdash;and all the appliances and gadgets
that use them&mdash;owe their existence to Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce.

<p>How could two people invent the same thing at exactly the same time? Easy:
integrated circuits were an idea waiting to happen. By the mid-1950s,
the world (and the military, in particular) had discovered the
amazing potential of electronic computers and it was blindingly
apparent to visionaries like Kilby and Noyce that there needed to be
a better way of building and connecting transistors in large
quantities. Kilby was working at Texas Instruments when he came upon
the idea he called the <B>monolithic principle</B>:
trying to build all the different parts of an electronic circuit on a silicon chip.
On September 12, 1958, he hand-built the world's first, crude integrated circuit
using a chip of germanium (a semiconducting element similar to
silicon) and Texas Instruments applied for a patent on the
idea the following year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at another company called Fairchild Semiconductor (formed by
transistor pioneer William Shockley and a small group of associates),
the equally brilliant Robert Noyce was experimenting with miniature
circuits of his own. In 1959, he used a series of photographic
and chemical techniques known as the <B>planar process</B>
(which had just been developed by a colleague, Jean Hoerni)
to produce the first, practical, integrated circuit, a method that Fairchild then tried to
patent.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/kilby-noyce-patents-compared.png" class="irightno" height="450" width="400" ALT="Integrated circuit patent diagrams from 1959 by Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor, compared side by side."></p>

<p>
There was considerable overlap between the two men's work and Texas
Instruments and Fairchild battled in the courts for much of the 1960s over who
had really developed the integrated circuit. Finally, in 1969, the
companies agreed to share the idea. </p>
<p>Kilby and Noyce are now rightly regarded as joint-inventors of
arguably the most important and far-reaching technology developed in the 20th
century. Both men were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of
Fame (Kilby in 1982, Noyce the following year) and Kilby's
breakthrough was also recognized with the award of a half-share in the 
<a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2000/kilby-autobio.html" target="_blank">Nobel Prize in
Physics in 2000</A> (as Kilby very generously noted in his acceptance speech, 
Noyce would surely have shared in the prize too had he not died of a heart attack a decade earlier).</P>

<P>While Kilby is remembered as a brilliant scientist, Noyce's legacy has an
added dimension. In 1968, he co-founded the Intel Electronics company
with <B>Gordon Moore</B> (1929&#8211;), which went on to develop the microprocessor
(single-chip computer) in 1974. With IBM, Microsoft, Apple, and other
pioneering companies, Intel is credited with helping to bring
affordable personal computers to our homes and workplaces. Thanks to Noyce and
Kilby, and brilliant engineers who subsequently built on their work, there are now something like two billion computers in use
throughout the world, many of them incorporated into <a href="cellphones.html">cellphones</A>,
portable <a href="howgpsworks.html">satellite navigation</A> devices, and other electronic gadgets.</p>

<p><span class="credit">Artwork: Snap! Two great electrical engineers, Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce, came up with the same idea at almost exactly the same time in 1959. Although Kilby filed his patent first, Noyce's patent was granted earlier. Here are drawings from their original patent applications. You can see that we have essentially the same idea in both, with electronic components formed from junctions between layers of p-type (blue) and n-type (red) semiconductors. Connections to the p-type and n-type regions are shown in orange and yellow and the base layers (substrates) are shown in green.

offer a great way to do that. For people who want a more detailed insight, here a couple of key patents by Kilby and Noyce that are worth looking at:</P>

<UL>
<LI><a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US3115581" target="_blank">US Patent 3,115,581: Miniature semiconductor integrated circuit</A> by Jack S. Kilby, Texas Instruments, filed May 6, 1959 and issued December 24, 1963. Describes the basic idea of making integrated circuits "using only one material for all circuit elements and a limited number of compatible process steps for the production thereof."</LI>
<LI><a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US2981877" target="_blank">US Patent 2,981,877: Semiconductor device and lead structure</A> by Robert N. Noyce, Fairchild Semiconductor, filed July 30, 1959 and issued April 25, 1961. Although Noyce applied for this invention over two months after Kilby, the Noyce patent was granted over two years earlier, which helped to fuel the bitter battle between Texas Instruments and Fairchild over who exactly had invented the integrated circuit.</LI>
