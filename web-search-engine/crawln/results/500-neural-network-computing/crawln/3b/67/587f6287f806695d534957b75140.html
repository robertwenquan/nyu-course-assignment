<h2>Electricity and electronics</h2>

<p class="center"><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/kettleelement.jpg" alt="Photo of electric kettle heating element covered in limescale." height="225" width="300" class="irightno"></p>

<p>If you've read our article about <a href="electricity.html">electricity</a>,
you'll know it's a kind of <a href="energy.html">energy</a>&#8212;a very
versatile kind of energy that we can make in all sorts of ways and use
in many more. Electricity is all about making electromagnetic energy
flow around a circuit so that it will drive something like an <a
 href="electricmotors.html">electric motor</a> or a <a href="heating-elements.html">heating element</a>,
powering appliances such as <a href="electriccars.html">electric cars</a>,
<a href="how-electric-kettles-work.html">kettles</A>, <a href="electrictoasters.html">toasters</a>, and
<a href="incandescentlamp.html">lamps</a>.
Generally, electrical appliances need a great deal of energy to make
them work so they use quite large (and often quite dangerous) electric
currents.</p>
<p>Electronics is a much more subtle kind of electricity in which tiny
electric currents (and, in theory, single electrons) are carefully
directed around much more complex circuits to process signals (such as
those that carry <a href="radio.html">radio</A> and 
<a href="television.html">television</A> programs) or store and process
information. Think of something like a <a href="microwaveovens.html">microwave
oven</a> and it's easy to see the difference between ordinary
electricity and electronics. In a microwave, electricity provides the
power that generates high-energy waves that cook your food; electronics
controls the electrical circuit that does the cooking. </p>

<p><span class="credit">Photo: The 2500-watt heating element inside this electric kettle
operates on a current of about 10 amps. By contrast, electronic components use currents
likely to be measured in fractions of milliamps (which are thousandths of amps). In other words, a typical 
electric appliance is likely to be using currents tens, hundreds, or thousands
of times bigger than a typical electronic one.<span></p>

<h2>Analog and digital electronics</h2>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/digital-clock.jpg" class="ileftno" alt="Large digital clock used on a road race." height="158" width="300"></p>

<p><span class="credit">Photo: Digital technology: Large digital clocks like this are quick and easy for runners to read. Photo by Jhi L. Scott courtesy of <a href="http://www.navy.mil/view_image.asp?id=74627" target="_blank">US Navy</A>.</span></p>

<p>There are two very different ways of storing information&#8212;known as
<a href="analog-and-digital.html">analog and digital</a>. It sounds like quite an abstract idea, but it's
really very simple. Suppose you take an old-fashioned photograph of
someone with a <a href="how-film-cameras-work.html">film camera</A>. The camera captures light streaming in
through the shutter at the front as a pattern of light
and dark areas on chemically treated <a href="plastics.html">plastic</a>.
The scene you're
photographing is converted into a kind of instant, chemical painting&#8212;an
"analogy" of what you're looking at. That's why we say this is an <span
 class="bold">analog</span>
way of storing information. But if you take a photograph of exactly the
same scene with a <a href="digitalcameras.html">digital camera</a>,
the camera stores a very different record. Instead of saving a
recognizable pattern of light and dark, it converts the light and dark
areas into numbers and stores those instead. Storing a numerical, coded
version of something is known as <span class="bold">digital</span>.</p>
<p>Electronic equipment generally works on information in either analog
or digital format. In an old-fashioned transistor <a href="radio.html">radio</a>,
broadcast signals enter the radio's circuitry via the <a href="antennas.html">antenna</A> sticking
out of the case. These are analog signals: they are radio waves,
traveling through the air from a distant radio transmitter, that
vibrate
up and down in a pattern that corresponds exactly to the words and
music they carry. So loud rock music means bigger signals than quiet
classical music. The radio keeps the signals in analog form as it
receives them, boosts them, and turns them back into sounds you can
hear. But in a modern <a href="radio.html">digital radio</a>,
things happen in a different way. First, the signals travel in digital
format&#8212;as coded numbers. When they arrive at your radio, the numbers
are converted back into sound signals. It's a very different way of
processing information and it has both advantages and disadvantages.
Generally, most modern forms of electronic equipment (including <a
 href="howcomputerswork.html">computers</a>, <a href="cellphones.html">cell
phones</a>, <a href="digitalcameras.html">digital cameras</a>, <a
 href="radio.html">digital radios</a>,
<a href="hearingaids.html">hearing aids</A>, and <a href="television.html">televisions</A>) use
digital electronics.</p>
<h2>Electronic components</h2>
<p>If you've ever looked down on a city from a skyscraper window,
you'll have marveled at all the tiny little buildings beneath you and
the streets linking them together in all sorts of intricate ways. Every
building has a function and the streets, which allow people to travel
from one part of a city to another or visit different buildings in
turn, make all the buildings work together. The collection of
buildings, the way they're arranged, and the many connections between
them is what makes a vibrant city so much more than the sum of its
individual parts. </p>
<p>The circuits inside pieces of electronic equipment are a bit like
cities too: they're packed with <span class="bold">components</span>
(similar to
buildings) that do different jobs and the components are linked
together by cables or printed metal <span class="bold">connections</span>
(similar to
streets). Unlike in a city, where virtually every building is unique
and even two supposedly identical homes or office blocks may be subtly
different, electronic circuits are built up from a small number of
standard components. But, just like LEGO&reg;, you can put these
components together in an infinite number of different places so they
do an infinite number of different jobs.</p>

<p>These are some of the most important components you'll encounter:</p>


<!-- Table row  -->
<div class="tableft">
<h3>Resistors</h3>
<p>These are the simplest components in any circuit. Their job is to restrict the flow of electrons and reduce the
current or voltage flowing by converting electrical energy into heat.
Resistors come in many different shapes and sizes. Variable resistors
(also known as potentiometers) have a dial control on them so they
change the amount of resistance when you turn them. Volume controls in
audio equipment use variable resistors like these.</P>

<!-- End table row  -->

<!-- Table row  -->
<div class="tableft">
<h3>Diodes</h3>
<p>The electronic equivalents of one-way streets, diodes allow an electric current to flow
through them in only one direction. They are also known as rectifiers.
Diodes can be used to change alternating currents (ones flowing back
and forth round a circuit, constantly swapping direction) into direct
currents (ones that always flow in the same direction).</P>
<P>Read more in our main article about <a href="diodes.html">diodes</A>.</p>
<p><span class="credit">Photo: Diodes look similar to resistors but work in a different way
and do a completely different job. Unlike a resistor, which can be inserted into a circuit
either way around, a diode has to be wired in the right direction (corresponding to the arrow
on this circuit board).</span></p>

<h3>Capacitors</h3>
<p>These relatively simple components consist of two pieces of conducting material (such as metal) separated by a
non-conducting (insulating) material called a dielectric. They are
often used as timing devices, but they can transform electrical
currents in other ways too. In a radio, one of the most important jobs,
tuning into the station you want to listen to, is done by a capacitor.</P>

<h3>Transistors</h3>
<p>Easily the most important components in computers, transistors can
switch tiny electric currents on and off or amplify them (transform
small electric currents into much larger ones). Transistors that work
as switches act as the memories in computers, while transistors working
as amplifiers boost the volume of sounds in <a href="hearingaids.html">hearing aids</A>. When
transistors are connected together, they make devices called <a href="logicgates.html">logic gates</a> that can carry out very basic
forms of decision making. (<a href="how-thyristors-work.html">Thyristors</a> are a little bit like transistors, but
work in a different way.)</P>

<h3>Opto-electronic (optical electronic) components</h3>
<p>There are various components that can turn light into electricity or vice-versa.
<a href="how-photoelectric-cells-work.html">Photocells</a> (also known as
photoelectric cells) generate tiny electric
currents when light falls on them and they're used as "magic eye" beams
in various types of sensing equipment, including some kinds of <a

<a href="diodes.html">Light-emitting diodes (LEDs)</a>
work in the opposite way, converting small electric currents
into light. LEDs are typically used on the instrument panels of stereo
equipment. <a href="lcdtv.html">Liquid crystal displays (LCDs)</a>, such as those used in
flatscreen LCD televisions and laptop
computers, are more sophisticated examples of opto-electronics.</P>

<p>Electronic components have something very important in common.
Whatever job they do, they work by controlling the flow of electrons
through their structure in a very precise way. Most of these components
are made of solid pieces of partly conducting, partly insulating
materials called <span class="bold">semiconductors</span> (described
in more detail in our
article about <a href="howtransistorswork.html">transistors</a>). Because electronics involves understanding
the precise mechanisms of how solids let electrons pass through them,
it's sometimes known as <span class="bold">solid-state</span> physics.
That's why you'll often see pieces of electronic equipment described as "solid-state."</p>

<h2>Electronic circuits</h2>
<p>The key to an electronic device is not just the components it
contains, but the way they are arranged in circuits. The simplest
possible circuit is a continuous loop connecting two components, like
two beads fastened on the same necklace. Analog electronic appliances
tend to have far simpler circuits than digital ones. A basic transistor
radio might have a few dozen different components and a circuit board
probably no bigger than the cover of a paperback book. But in something
like a <a
 href="howcomputerswork.html">computer</a>, which uses digital technology, circuits are much more
dense and complex and include hundreds, thousands, or even millions of
separate
pathways. Generally speaking, the more complex the circuit, the more
intricate the operations it can perform.</p>

<p>If you've experimented with simple electronics, you'll know that the
easiest way to build a circuit is simply to connect components together
with short lengths of <a href="copper.html">copper</a> cable. But the more components you have to
connect, the harder this becomes. That's why electronics designers
usually opt for a more systematic way of arranging components on what's
called a <span class="bold">circuit board</span>. A basic circuit
board is simply a
rectangle of <a href="plastics.html">plastic</a> with copper connecting tracks on one side and lots
of holes drilled through it. You can easily connect components together
by poking them through the holes and using the copper to link them
together, removing bits of copper as necessary, and adding extra wires
to make additional connections. This type of circuit board is often
called "breadboard".<br>
</p>
<p>Electronic equipment that you buy in stores takes this idea a step
further using circuit boards that are made automatically in factories.
The exact layout of the circuit is printed chemically onto a plastic
board, with all the copper tracks created automatically during the
manufacturing process. Components are then simply pushed through
pre-drilled holes and fastened into place with a kind of electrically
conducting adhesive known as <a href="weldingsoldering.html">solder</A>. A circuit manufactured in this way
is known as a <span class="bold">printed circuit board (PCB)</span>.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/soldering-circuit2.jpg" class="ileftno" height="225" width="300" ALT="Soldering an electronic circuit board"></p>

<p><span class="credit">Photo: <a href="weldingsoldering.html">Soldering</A> components into an electronic
circuit. The smoke you can see comes from the solder melting and turning to a vapor. The blue plastic rectangle I'm soldering onto here is a typical printed circuit board&mdash;and you see various components sticking up from it, including a bunch of resistors at the front and a large integrated circuit at the top.</span></p>


<p>Although PCBs are a great advance on hand-wired circuit boards,
they're still quite difficult to use when you need to connect hundreds,
thousands, or even millions of components together. The reason early
computers were so big, power hungry, slow, expensive, and unreliable is
because their components were wired together manually in this
old-fashioned way. In the late 1950s, however, engineers Jack Kilby and
Robert Noyce independently developed a way of creating electronic
components in miniature form on the surface of pieces of silicon. Using
these <a href="integratedcircuits.html">integrated circuits</A>, it rapidly became
possible to squeeze hundreds, thousands, millions, and then hundreds of millions of
miniaturized components onto chips of silicon about the size of a
finger nail. That's how computers became smaller, cheaper, and much
more reliable from the 1960s onward.</p>

<h2>Electronics around us</h2>

<p>Electronics is now so pervasive that it's almost easier to think of
things that don't use it than of things that do.</p>
<p>Entertainment was one of the first areas to benefit, with <a
 href="radio.html">radio</a> (and
later <a href="television.html">television</a>) both critically
dependent on the arrival of
electronic components. Although the <a href="telephone.html">telephone</a>
was invented before electronics was properly developed, modern
telephone systems, <a href="cellphones.html">cellphone</a> networks,
and the computers networks at
the heart of the <a href="internet.html">Internet</a> all benefit from
sophisticated, digital electronics. </p>
<p>Try to think of something you do that doesn't involve electronics
and you may struggle. Your <a href="carengines.html">car engine</a>
probably has electronic circuits
in it&mdash;and what about the <a href="howgpsworks.html">GPS</a> satellite
navigation device that tells you where to go? Even the <a href="airbags.html">airbag</A> in your
steering wheel is triggered by an electronic circuit that detects when
you need some extra protection. </p>
<p>Electronic equipment saves our lives in other ways too. Hospitals
are packed with all kinds of electronic gadgets, from heart-rate
monitors and <a href="ultrasound.html">ultrasound</A> scanners to complex brain scanners and <a href="xrays.html">X-ray</A>
machines. <a href="hearingaids.html">Hearing aids</a> were among the first gadgets to benefit from the
development of tiny transistors in the mid-20th century, and
ever-smaller integrated circuits have allowed hearing aids to become
smaller and more powerful in the decades ever since.</p>
<p>Who'd have thought have electrons&#8212;just about the smallest things you
could ever imagine&#8212;would change people's lives in so many important
ways?</p>

<h2>A brief history of electronics</h2>
<ul>
<li>1874: Irish scientist <span class="bold">George Johnstone Stoney</span>
(1826&ndash;1911) suggests electricity must be "built" out of tiny electrical
charges. He coins the name "electron" about 20 years later.</li>
<li>1875: American scientist <span class="bold">George R. Carey</span>
builds a photoelectric cell that makes electricity when light shines on
it.</li>
<li>1879: Englishman <span class="bold">Sir William Crookes</span>
(1832&ndash;1919) develops his cathode-ray tube (similar to an old-style,
"tube"-based <a href="television.html">television</a>) to study
electrons (which were then known as "cathode rays").</li>
<li>1883: Prolific American inventor <span class="bold">Thomas Edison</span>
(1847&ndash;1931) discovers thermionic emission (also known as the Edison
effect), where electrons are given off by a heated filament.</li>
<li>1887: German physicist <span class="bold">Heinrich Hertz</span>
(1857&ndash;1894) finds out more about the photoelectric effect, the
connection between light and electricity that Carey had stumbled on the
previous decade.</li>
<li>1897: British physicist <span class="bold">J.J. Thomson</span>
(1856&ndash;1940) shows that cathode rays are negatively charged particles.
They are soon renamed electrons.</li>
<li>1904: <span class="bold">John Ambrose Fleming</span>
(1849&ndash;1945), an English scientist, produces the Fleming valve (later
renamed the diode). It becomes an indispensable component in radios.</li>
<li>1906: American inventor <span class="bold">Lee De Forest</span>
(1873&ndash;1961), goes one better and develops an improved valve known as
the triode (or audion), greatly improving the design of radios. De
Forest is often credited as a father of modern radio.</li>
<li>1947: Americans <span class="bold">John Bardeen</span>
(1908&ndash;1991), <span class="bold">Walter Brattain</span> (1902&ndash;1987), and
<span class="bold">William Shockley</span> (1910&ndash;1989)
develop the transistor at Bell Laboratories. It revolutionizes electronics and digital
computers in the second half of the 20th century.</li>
<li>1958: Working independently, American engineers <span class="bold">Jack Kilby</span> (1923&ndash;2005) of Texas Instruments and
<span class="bold">Robert Noyce</span> (1927&ndash;1990) of Fairchild
Semiconductor (and later of Intel) develop integrated circuits.</li>
<li>1987: American scientists <span class="bold">Theodore Fulton</span> and <span class="bold">Gerald Dolan</span> of Bell Laboratories
develop the first single-electron transistor.</li>
