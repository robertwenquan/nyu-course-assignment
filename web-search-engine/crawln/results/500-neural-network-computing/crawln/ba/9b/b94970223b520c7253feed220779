<UL>
	<LI>	These days I work full time for 
		<A HREF="http://www.nonlinear-solutions-oy.com/">
		Ab Nonlinear Solutions Oy. </A>
		We help process industries with process and product development;
		to improve quality, improve process control, reduce consumption of 
		raw materials and/or energy, reduce defects, using 
		<A HREF="http://www.nonlinear-solutions-oy.com/what_is_NM.php">
		nonlinear modelling</A>. <BR> <BR>
	
	<LI>	Since 1992, I am a docent (translated as "adjunct professor" in 
		Finland, and "associate professor" in Sweden)
		in the chemical engineering department here,
		and therefore participate from time to time in teaching
		and <A HREF="r.php">research activities</A>. <BR> <BR>

	<LI>	I have taught several industrial courses on nonlinear modelling
		or neural networks for process industries. <BR> <BR>

	<LI> 	In 1994, I set up an international conference series called 
		<A HREF="EANN.html"> Engineering Applications of Neural 
		Networks </A>. I have handed over the responsibility 
		for the conference to Prof. Dimitris Tsaptsinos of Kingston
		University, UK several years back. <BR> <BR> 

	<LI> 	I have edited 6 <A HREF="books.html">books</A>
		including <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Neural-Networks-Chemical-Engineers-Bulsari/dp/0444820973">
		<b>  Neural Networks for Chemical Engineers </b> </A> (Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1995). 
<!-- A HREF="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/525134/description#description">
<!--		<b>Neural Networks for Chemical Engineers</b></A> (Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1995). -->
		This book is now out of print, and the copyright is no
		longer with Elsevier. <BR> <BR> 

	<LI>	Besides about 200 publications, including papers in journals, 
		magazines, conferences and technical reports, I have
		edited as a guest editor 6 <A HREF="spi.html"> special 
		issues of journals. These days I write mostly technical articles
		in trade magazines. </A> <BR> <BR> 

	<LI>	I seem to be on the editorial board of a couple of journals, and on
		program committees of some conferences, and therefore end up
		reviewing a number of papers every year. Please do not bother to send
                me papers to review which are not in my field. <BR> <BR>
