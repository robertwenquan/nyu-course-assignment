<p>Where can neural network systems help?
<ul>
<li>
where we can't formulate an algorithmic solution.</li>

<li>
where we <i>can</i> get lots of examples of the behaviour we require.</li>

<li>
where we need to pick out the structure from existing data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="what"></a>What is a neural network?</h3>
Neural Networks are a different paradigm for computing:
<ul>
<li>
von Neumann machines are based on the processing/memory abstraction of
human information processing.</li>

<li>
neural networks are <i>based on the parallel architecture of animal brains</i>.</li>
</ul>
Neural networks are a form of multiprocessor computer system, with
<ul>
<li>
simple processing elements</li>

<li>
a high degree of interconnection</li>

<li>
simple scalar messages</li>

<li>
adaptive interaction between elements</li>
</ul>
A biological neuron may have as many as 10,000 different inputs, and may
send its output (the presence or absence of a short-duration spike) to
many other neurons. Neurons are wired up in a 3-dimensional pattern.
<p>Real brains, however, are orders of magnitude more complex than any
artificial neural network so far considered.
<p>Example: A simple single unit adaptive network:
<p><img SRC="graphic2.gif"  align=LEFT>
<p>The network has 2 inputs, and one output. All are binary. The output
is
<p><MATH>1 if W<sub>0</sub> *I<sub>0</sub> + W<sub>1</sub> * I<sub>1</sub>
+ W<sub>b</sub> > 0&nbsp;</MATH>
<p><MATH>0 if W<sub>0</sub> *I<sub>0</sub> + W<sub>1</sub> * I<sub>1</sub>
+ W<sub>b</sub> &lt;= 0&nbsp;</MATH>
<p>We want it to learn simple OR: output a 1 if either I<sub>0</sub> or
I<sub>1</sub> is 1.
<h3>
<a NAME="algs"></a>Algorithms and Architectures.</h3>

<h4>
The simple Perceptron:</h4>
The network adapts as follows: <i>change the weight by an amount proportional
to the difference between the desired output and the actual output.</i>
<p>As an equation:
<p><math>&Delta; W<sub>i</sub> = &eta; * (D-Y).I<sub>i</sub></math>
<p>where <math>&eta;</math> is the learning rate, D is the desired output, and Y
is the actual output.
<p>This is called the <i>Perceptron Learning Rule</i>, and goes back to
the early 1960's.
<p>We expose the net to the patterns:
<center><table BORDER=3 >
<tr>
<th>I<sub>0</sub></th>

<th>I<sub>1</sub></th>

<th>Desired output</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>0</td>

<td>0</td>

<td>0</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>0</td>

<td>1</td>

<td>1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1</td>

<td>0</td>

<td>1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1</td>

<td>1</td>

<td>1</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>We <i>train</i> the network on these examples. Weights after each epoch
(exposure to complete set of patterns)&nbsp;<img SRC="graphic4.gif"  align=LEFT>
<p>At this point (8) the network has finished learning. Since (D-Y)=0 for
all patterns, the weights cease adapting. Single perceptrons are limited
in what they can learn:
<p>If we have two inputs, the decision surface is a line. ... and its equation
is
<p><math>I<sub>1</sub> = (W<sub>0</sub>/W<sub>1</sub>).I<sub>0</sub> +
(W<sub>b</sub>/W<sub>1</sub>)&nbsp;</math>
<p><img SRC="graphic5.gif"  align=LEFT>
<p>In general, they implement a simple hyperplane decision surface
<p>This restricts the possible mappings available.
<h4>
Developments from the simple perceptron:</h4>
Back-Propagated Delta Rule Networks (BP) (sometimes known and multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs)) and Radial Basis Function Networks (RBF) are both well-known
developments of the Delta rule for single layer networks (itself a development
of the Perceptron Learning Rule). Both can learn arbitrary mappings or
classifications. Further, the inputs (and outputs) can have real values
<h5>
Back-Propagated Delta Rule Networks (BP)</h5>
is a development from the simple Delta rule in which extra <i>hidden layers</i>
(layers additional to the input and output layers, not connected externally)
are added. The network topology is constrained to be <i>feedforward</i>:
i.e. loop-free - generally connections are allowed from the input layer
to the first (and possibly only) hidden layer; from the first hidden layer
to the second,..., and from the last hidden layer to the output layer.
<h5>
Typical BP network architecture:</h5>
<img SRC="graphic6.gif"  align=LEFT>
<p>The hidden layer learns to <i>recode</i> (or to <i>provide a representation</i>
for) the inputs. More than one hidden layer can be used.
<p>The architecture is more powerful than single-layer networks: it can
be shown that any mapping can be learned, given two hidden layers (of units).
<p>The units are a little more complex than those in the original perceptron:
their input/output graph is
<p><img SRC="graphic7.gif"  align=LEFT>
<p>As a function:
<p><MATH>Y = 1 / (1+&nbsp;<PCDATA>exp</PCDATA>(-k.(&Sigma; W<sub>in </sub>*
X<sub>in</sub>))&nbsp;</math>
<p>The graph shows the output for <i>k=0.5, 1, and 10,</i> as the activation
varies from -10 to 10.
<h5>
Training BP Networks</h5>
The weight change rule is a development of the perceptron learning rule.
Weights are changed by an amount proportional to <i>the error at that unit</i>
times <i>the output of the unit feeding into the weight</i>.
<p>Running the network consists of
<dl>
<dt>
Forward pass:</dt>

<dd>
the outputs are calculated and the error at the output units calculated.</dd>

<dt>
Backward pass:</dt>

<dd>
The output unit error is used to alter weights on the output units. Then
the error at the hidden nodes is calculated (by <i>back-propagating</i>
the error at the output units through the weights), and the weights on
the hidden nodes altered using these values.</dd>
</dl>
For each data pair to be learned a forward pass and backwards pass is performed.
This is repeated over and over again until the error is at a low enough
level (or we give up).
<h5>
Radial Basis function Networks</h5>
Radial basis function networks are also feedforward, but have only <i>one</i>
hidden layer.
<h5>
Typical RBF architecture:</h5>
<img SRC="graphic8.gif"  align=LEFT>
<p>Like BP, RBF nets can learn arbitrary mappings: the primary difference
is in the hidden layer.
<p>RBF hidden layer units have a <i>receptive field</i> which has a <i>centre:
</i>that is, a particular input value at which they have a maximal output.Their
output tails off as the input moves away from this point.
<p>Generally, the hidden unit function is a Gaussian:
<p><img SRC="graphic9.gif"  align=LEFT>
<p>Gaussians with three different standard deviations.
<h5>
Training RBF Networks.</h5>
RBF networks are trained by
<ul>
<li>
deciding on how many hidden units there should be</li>

<li>
deciding on their centres and the sharpnesses (standard deviation) of their
Gaussians</li>

<li>
training up the output layer.</li>
</ul>
Generally, the centres and SDs are decided on first by examining the vectors
in the training data. The output layer weights are then trained using the
Delta rule. BP is the most widely applied neural network technique. RBFs
are gaining in popularity.
<p>Nets can be
<ul>
<li>
trained on classification data (each output represents one class), and
then used directly as classifiers of new data.</li>

<li>
trained on (x,f(x)) points of an unknown function f, and then used to interpolate.</li>
</ul>
RBFs have the advantage that one can add extra units with centres near
parts of the input which are difficult to classify. Both BP and RBFs can
also be used for processing time-varying data: one can consider a <i>window</i>
on the data:
<p><img SRC="graphic10.gif"  align=LEFT>
<p>Networks of this form (finite-impulse response) have been used in many
applications.
<p>There are also networks whose architectures are specialised for processing
time-series.
<h3>
Unsupervised networks:</h3>
Simple Perceptrons, BP, and RBF networks need a teacher to tell the network
what the desired output should be. These are supervised networks.
<p>In an unsupervised net, the network adapts purely in response to its
inputs. Such networks can learn to pick out structure in their input.
<h4>
Applications for unsupervised nets</h4>

<dl>
<dt>
clustering data:</dt>

<dd>
exactly one of a small number of output units comes on in response to an
input.</dd>

<dt>
reducing the dimensionality of data:</dt>

<dd>
data with high dimension (a large number of input units) is compressed
into a lower dimension (small number of output units).</dd>
</dl>
Although learning in these nets can be slow, running the trained net is
very fast - even on a computer simulation of a neural net.
<h4>
Kohonen clustering Algorithm:</h4>
- takes a high-dimensional input, and clusters it, but retaining some topological
ordering of the output.
<p><img SRC="graphic11.gif"  align=LEFT>
<p>After training, an input will cause <i>some</i> the output units in
some area to become active.
<p>Such clustering (and dimensionality reduction) is very useful as a preprocessing
stage, whether for further neural network data processing, or for more
traditional techniques.
<h3>
<a NAME="where"></a>Where are Neural Networks applicable?</h3>
..... or are they just a solution in search of a problem?
<p>Neural networks cannot do anything that cannot be done using traditional
computing techniques, <b>BUT</b> they can do some things which would otherwise
be very difficult.
<p>In particular, they can form a model from their training data (or possibly
input data) alone.
<p>This is particularly useful with sensory data, or with data from a complex
(e.g. chemical, manufacturing, or commercial) process. There may be an
algorithm, but it is not known, or has too many variables. It is easier
to let the network learn from examples.
<h5>
Neural networks are being used:</h5>

<dl>
<dt>
in investment analysis:</dt>

<dd>
to attempt to predict the movement of stocks currencies etc., from previous
data. There, they are replacing earlier simpler linear models.</dd>

<dt>
in signature analysis:</dt>

<dd>
as a mechanism for comparing signatures made (e.g. in a bank) with those
stored. This is one of the first large-scale applications of neural networks
in the USA, and is also one of the first to use a neural network chip.</dd>

<dt>
in process control:</dt>

<dd>
there are clearly applications to be made here: most processes cannot be
determined as computable algorithms. Newcastle University Chemical Engineering
Department is working with industrial partners (such as Zeneca and BP)
in this area.</dd>

<dt>
in monitoring:</dt>

<dd>
networks have been used to monitor</dd>

<ul>
<li>
the state of aircraft engines. By monitoring vibration levels and sound,
early warning of engine problems can be given.</li>

<li>
British Rail have also been testing a similar application monitoring diesel
engines.</li>
</ul>

<dt>
in marketing:</dt>

<dd>
networks have been used to improve marketing mailshots. One technique is
to run a test mailshot, and look at the pattern of returns from this. The
idea is to find a predictive mapping from the data known about the clients
to how they have responded. This mapping is then used to direct further
mailshots.</dd>

<h3>
<a NAME="new"></a>Where are neural networks going?</h3>
A great deal of research is going on in neural networks worldwide.
<p>This ranges from basic research into new and more efficient learning
algorithms, to networks which can respond to temporally varying patterns
(both ongoing at Stirling), to techniques for implementing neural networks
directly in silicon. Already one chip commercially available exists, but
it does not include adaptation. Edinburgh University have implemented a
neural network chip, and are working on the learning problem.
<p>Production of a learning chip would allow the application of this technology
to a whole range of problems where the price of a PC and software cannot
be justified.
<p>There is particular interest in sensory and sensing applications: nets
which learn to interpret real-world sensors and learn about their environment.
<h4>
New Application areas:</h4>

<dl>
<dt>
Pen PC's</dt>

<dd>
PC's where one can write on a tablet, and the writing will be recognised
and translated into (ASCII) text.</dd>

<dt>
Speech and Vision recognition systems</dt>

<dd>
Not new, but Neural Networks are becoming increasingly part of such systems.
They are used as a system component, in conjunction with traditional computers.</dd>

<dt>
White goods and toys</dt>

<dd>
As Neural Network chips become available, the possibility of simple cheap
systems which have learned to recognise simple entities (e.g. walls looming,
or simple commands like Go, or Stop), may lead to their incorporation in
toys and washing machines etc. Already the Japanese are using a related
technology, fuzzy logic, in this way. There is considerable interest in
the combination of fuzzy and neural technologies.</dd>

<h3> <A name="comments2001">Some comments (added September 2001)</A> </h3>
Reading this through, it is a bit outdated: not that there's anything incorrect above, but the world has moved on. Neural Networks should be seen as part of a larger field sometimes called <i> Soft Computing</i> or <i> Natural Computing</i>. In the last few years, there has been a real movement of the discipline in three different directions:
<DL>
	<DT>Neural networks, statistics, generative models, Bayesian inference
	<DD>There is a sense in which these fields are coalescing. The real problem is making conclusions from incomplete, noisy data, and all of these fields offer something in this area. Developments in the mathematics underlying these fileds have shown that there are real similarities in the techniques used. Chris Bishop's <A HREF="http://www.ncrg.aston.ac.uk/NNPR/index.html">book</A> Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition, Oxford University Press is a good start on this area. 
	<DT> Neuromorphic Systems
	<DD> Existing neural network (and indeed other soft computing) systems are generally software models for solving static problems on PCs. But why not free the concept from the workstation? The area of neuromorphic systems is concerned with real-time implementations of neurally inspired systems, generally implemented directly in silicon, for sensory and motor tasks. Another aspect is direct implementation of detailed aspects of neurons in silicon (see Biological Neural Networks below). The main centres worldwide are at the <A HREF="http://www.ini.unizh.ch/index.html">Institute for neuroinformatics</A> at Zurich, and at <A HREF="http://www.erc.caltech.edu/">the Center for Neuromorphic Systems Engineering</A> at Caltech. There are also some useful links from the  <A HREF="http://www.ine-web.org/"> Institute for Neuromorphic Engineering</A>. Indeed, the US DARPA has now discovered Neuromorphic Systems, and are <A href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/02/darpa-2009-brai.html">funding research</a> in this area (e.g. SyNAPSE). 

	<DT> Biological Neural Networks
	<DD> There is real interest in how neural network research and neurophysiology can come together. The pattern recognition aspects of Artificial Neural Networks don't really explain too much about how real brains actually work. The field called <A HREF="http://www.hirnforschung.net/cneuro/">Computational Neuroscience</A> has taken inspiration from both artificial neural networks and neurophysiology, and attempts to put the two together.
