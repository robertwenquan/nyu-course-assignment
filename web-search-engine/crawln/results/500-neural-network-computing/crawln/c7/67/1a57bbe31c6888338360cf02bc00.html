<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>nce upon a time, the way to get a <a
 href="howcomputerswork.html">computer</a> to do something useful was to feed
it a stack of cards
with holes punched into them. Thankfully, things have moved on a lot
since then. Now we can get our computers to do things simply by
pointing and clicking with a <a href="computermouse.html">mouse</a>&#8212;or
even by speaking ordinary
commands with <a href="voicerecognition.html">voice recognition</a>
software. But there's a
revolution coming that will make computers even easier to use&mdash;with
<span class="bold">touch-sensitive screens</span>.
<a href="cellphones.html">Cellphones</a> like Apple's iPhone, <a href="ebooks.html">ebook readers</A>, and some
<a href="how-mp3players-work.html">MP3 players</a> already work with
simple, touch controls&#8212;and computers are starting to work that way
too. Touchscreens are intuitively easy to use, but how exactly do
they work?</p>

<p><span class="credit">Photo: Left: The Sony <a href="ebooks.html">ebook</A> Reader features an <a href="electromagnetic-spectrum.html">infrared</A> touchscreen (described in more detail below).
That eliminates the need for a separate keyboard and allows the gadget to be much smaller and
more portable. You press the screen to turn pages and create bookmarks, and you can use a pop-up on-screen keyboard to make notes in the books you're reading, as I'm doing here.</span></p>

<h2>Keyboards and switches</h2>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/computer-keyboard-disassemble5.jpg" class="irightno" height="300" width="400" ALT="Computer keyboard pressure sensors"></p>

<p>A touchscreen is a bit
like an invisible keyboard glued to the front of your computer
monitor. To understand how it works, it helps if you know
something about how an ordinary keyboard works first.
You can find out about that in our article on 
<a href="computerkeyboards.html">computer keyboards</A>,
but here's a quick reminder.
Essentially, every key on a keyboard is an <a href="electricity.html">electrical</a>
switch. When you push a key
down, you complete an electric circuit and a current flows. The
current varies according to the key you press and that's how your
computer figures out what you're typing. </p>

<p>In a bit more detail,
here's what happens. Inside a keyboard, you'll find there are two
layers of electrically conducting <a href="plastics.html">plastic</a>
separated by an insulating
plastic membrane with holes in it. In fact, there's one hole
underneath each key. When you press a key, you push the top conductor
layer down towards the bottom layer so the two layers meet and touch
through the hole. A current flows between the layers and the computer
knows you've pressed a key. Little springy pieces of 
<a href="rubber.html">rubber</a>
underneath each key make them bounce back to their original position,
breaking the circuit
when you release them.</p>
<p>Touchscreens have to
achieve something similar to this on the surface on your computer
screen. Obviously they can't use switches, membranes, and bits of
plastic or they'd block the view of the screen below. So they have
to use more cunning tricks for sensing your touch&#8212;completely
invisibly!</p>
<p><span class="credit">Photo: This is the sensitive, switch layer from
inside a typical PC keyboard. It rests under the keys and detects when
you press them. There are three separate layers of plastic here. Two of
them are covered in electrically conducting metal tracks and there's an
insulating layer between them with holes in it. The dots you can see
are places where the keys press the two conducting layers together. The
lines are electrical connections that allow tiny electric currents to
flow when the layers are pressed tightly together.
</span></p>
<h2>How touchscreens work</h2>
<p>Different kinds of
touchscreen work in different ways. Some can sense only one finger
at a time and get extremely confused if you try to press in two places
at once.
Others can easily detect and distinguish more than one key press at
once. These are some of the main technologies:</p>


<!-- Table row  -->
<div class="tableft">
<h3>Resistive</h3>
<p>Resistive touchscreens (currently the most popular technology) work
a bit like "transparent keyboards" overlaid on top of the screen.
There's a flexible upper layer of conducting polyester <a href="plastics.html">plastic</a>
bonded to a rigid lower layer of conducting <a href="glass.html">glass</a> and separated
by an insulating
membrane. When you press on the screen, you force the polyester to
touch the glass and complete a circuit&#8212;just like pressing the key
on a keyboard. A chip inside the screen figures out the coordinates
of the place you touched.</p>
</div>

<div class="tabright">
<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/resistive-touchscreen.png" class="ileftno" alt="How a resistive touchscreen works" height="200" width="200"> </p>
<p><span class="credit">When you press a resistive touchscreen, you push two conducting layers together
so they make contact, a bit like an ordinary computer keyboard.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="tabclear"></div>
<!-- End table row  -->


<!-- Table row  -->
<div class="tableft">
<h3>Capacitive</h3>
<p>These screens are made from multiple layers of glass. The inner
layer conducts
electricity and so does the outer layer, so effectively the screen
behaves like two electrical conductors separated by an insulator&#8212;in
other words, a <a href="capacitors.html">capacitor</A>. When you bring your finger up to the
screen, you alter the electrical field by a certain amount that
varies according to where your hand is. Capacitive screens can be
touched in more than one place at once. Unlike most other types
of touchscreen, they don't work if you touch them with a plastic
stylus (because the plastic is an insulator and stops your hand from affecting the
electric field).</p>
</div>

<div class="tabright">
<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/capacitive-touchscreen.png" class="ileftno" alt="How a capacitive touchscreen works" height="200" width="200"> </p>
<p><span class="credit">In a capacitive touchscreen, the whole screen is like a capacitor. When you bring your finger up close,
you affect the electric field that exists between the inner and outer glass.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="tabclear"></div>
<!-- End table row  -->


<!-- Table row  -->
<div class="tableft">
<h3>Infrared</h3>
<p>Just like the magic eye beams in an <a href="intruderalarms.html">intruder
alarm</a>, an <a href="electromagnetic-spectrum.html">infrared</A> touchscreen uses a grid
pattern of <a href="diodes.html">LEDs</a> and light-detector
<a href="how-photoelectric-cells-work.html">photocells</A> arranged
on opposite sides of the screen. The LEDs shine infrared light in front of the screen&#8212;a
bit like an invisible spider's web. If you touch the screen at a
certain point, you interrupt two or more beams. A microchip inside
the screen can calculate where you touched by seeing which beams you
interrupted. The touchscreen on Sony Reader <a href="ebooks.html">ebooks</A> (like the one
pictured in our top photo) works this way. Since you're interrupting a beam,
infrared screens work just as well whether you use your finger or a stylus.</p>
</div>

<div class="tabright">
<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/infrared-touchscreen.png" class="ileftno" alt="How an infrared touchscreen works" height="200" width="200"> </p>
<p><span class="credit">An infrared touchscreen uses the same magic-eye technology that Tom Cruise had to dodge in the movie Mission Impossible. When your fingers move up close, they break invisible beams that pass over the surface of the screen between LEDs on one side and photocells on the other.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="tabclear"></div>
<!-- End table row  -->


<!-- Table row  -->
<div class="tableft">
<h3>Surface Acoustic Wave</h3>
<p>Surprisingly, this touchscreen technology detects your fingers using <a href="sound.html">sound</A> instead of
light. <a href="ultrasound.html">Ultrasonic</a> sound waves (too high
pitched for humans to hear)
are generated at the edges of the screen and reflected back and
forth across its surface. When you touch the screen, you interrupt
the sound beams and absorb some of their energy. The screen's microchip
controller figures out from this where exactly you touched the
screen.</p>
</div>

<div class="tabright">
<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/surface-acoustic-wave-touchscreen.png" class="ileftno" alt="How a surface-acoustic wave touchscreen works" height="200" width="200"> </p>
<p><span class="credit">A surface-acoustic wave screen is a bit like an infrared screen, but your finger interrupts high-frequency sound beams rippling over the surface instead of invisible light beams.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="tabclear"></div>

<!-- Table row  -->
<div class="tableft">
<h3>Near field imaging</h3>
<p>Have you noticed how an old-style <a href="radio.html">radio</a>
can buzz and whistle if you move your hand toward
it? That's because your body affects the electromagnetic field that
incoming radio waves create in and around the <a href="antennas.html">antenna</A>. The closer you
get, the more effect you have. Near field imaging (NFI) touchscreens
work a
similar way. As you move your finger up close, you change the
electric field on the glass screen, which instantly registers your
touch. Much more robust than some of the other technologies, NFI
screens are suitable for rough-and-tough environments (like military
use). Unlike most of the other technologies, they can also detect
touches from pens, styluses, or hands wearing gloves.</p>

<div class="tableft">
<h3>Light pens</h3>
<p>Light pens were an early form of touchscreen technology, but they worked in a completely different way to
modern touchscreens. In old-style computer screens, the picture was
drawn by an <a href="atoms.html">electron</a> beam that scanned back and forth,
just like in a cathode-ray tube <a href="television.html">television</A>.
The pen contained a <a href="how-photoelectric-cells-work.html">photoelectric cell</A> that detected
the electron beam as it passed by, sending a signal to the computer down a cable.
Since the computer knew exactly where the electron beam was at any moment, it could figure out
where the pen was pointing. Light pens could be used either to select menu items or text from the screen (similar
to a mouse) or, as shown in the picture here, to draw <a href="computer-graphics.html">computer graphics</A>.</P>

<h2>Advantages of touchscreens</h2>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/touchscreen-rail-tickets.jpg" class="irightno" height="250" width="300" ALT="A person buys rail tickets using a touchscreen kiosk"></p>

<p>The great thing about touchscreen technology is that it's incredibly
easy for people to use. Touchscreens can display just as much information (and just as
many touch buttons) as people need to complete a particular task and
no more, leading people through quite a complex process in a very
simple, systematic way. That's why touchscreen technology has proved
perfect for public information kiosks, ticket machines at railroad
stations, electronic voting machines, self-service grocery checkouts, military computers, and many
similar applications where computers with screens and keyboards would
be too troublesome to use.</p>

<p><span class="credit">Photo: Touchscreens are widely used in outdoor applications,
such as ticket machines at railroad stations. They're popular with customers, since you can often buy your train ticket more quickly without waiting in line. They're also good news for the station operator, since machines like this work out cheaper than paying a human sales person.</span></p>

<p>Some of us are lucky enough to own the latest touch phones, which
have multi-touch
screens. The big advantage here is that the display can show you a
screen geared to exactly what you're trying to do with it. If you
want to make a phone call, it can display the ordinary digits 0&ndash;9 so
you can dial. If you want to send an SMS text message, it can display
a keyboard (in alphabetical order or <a href="typewriter.html">typewriter</a>-style
QWERTY order, if
you prefer). If you want to play games, the display can change yet
again. Touchscreen displays like this are incredibly versatile:
minute by minute, they change to meet your expectations.</p>

<p>So far, most of us have had fairly limited exposure to touchscreen computers, but all that seems certain to change
as ever more people go online with mobile devices (cellphones and tablet computers such as iPhones and iPads).
Back in 2008, Microsoft <a target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7422924.stm">anounced</a>
that touch technologies would feature prominently in future versions of the Windows operating system&mdash;potentially making computer mice and keyboards obsolete&mdash;but it will take time for most of us to shift away from old computers and operating systems,
and the old ways of using them. Though it could be a while before we're all prodding and poking our
computers into action, touchscreen technology is definitely something we'll be seeing more of in future!</p>
</div>

<h2>Who invented touchscreens?</h2>

<P>Automobiles, <a href="howplaneswork.html">airplanes</a>,
<a href="howcomputerswork.html">computers</a>, and
<a href="steamengines.html">steam engines</a>&mdash;touchscreens belong in the company of these illustrious inventions because they lack a unique inventor and a definitive, "Eureka" moment of invention: in other words, no single man or woman invented the touchscreen.</P>

<P>The first invention that bears any kind of resemblance to using a modern touchscreen was called a <span class="bold">light pen</span> (featured in the photo up above), a stylus with a photocell in one end, and a wire running into the computer at the other end,
that could draw <a href="computer-graphics.html">graphics</A> on a screen. It was developed in the early 1950s and formed a part of one of the first computer systems to feature graphics, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlwind_(computer)" target="_blank">Project Whirlwind</A>. Light pens didn't really work like modern touchscreens, however, because there was nothing special about the screen itself: all the clever stuff happened inside the pen and the computer it was wired up to. </P>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/apple-newton-iphone.jpg" class="irightno" height="225" width="300" ALT="An Apple Newton next to an Apple iPhone."></p>

<P>During the 1960s and early 1970s, another key strand in the development of touchscreens came from the work of computer scientists who specialized in a field called human-computer interaction (HCI), which sought to bridge the gap between people and computers. Among them were
<a href="http://www.dougengelbart.org/" target="_blank">Douglas Engelbart</a>, inventor of the computer mouse;
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Sutherland" target="_blank">Ivan Sutherland</A>, a pioneer of computer graphics and <a href="virtualreality.html">virtual reality</A>; and Alan Kay, a colleague of Sutherland's who helped to pioneer the graphical user interface (or GUI&mdash;the picture-based desktop used on virtually all modern computers).</P>

<P>The first gadget that worked in any way like a modern touchscreen was called a "Discriminating Contact Sensor," and it was patented on October 7, 1975 by George S. Hurst and William C. Colwell of Elographics, Inc.  Much like a modern resistive touchscreen, it was a device with two electrically conducting contact layers separated by an insulating layer that you could press together with a pen. Crucially, it was designed to be operated "with a writing instrument [the patent drawings show a pen] and not by any portion of a writer's hand". So it wasn't like a modern, finger-operated touchscreen device. (See <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US3911215" target="_blank">US patent #3,911,215</A> for more details.)</P>

<P>Many people think touchscreens only arrived when Steve Jobs unveiled Apple's iPhone in 2007&mdash;but touch-operated, handheld computers had already been around for 20 years by then. One of the first was the
<a href="http://oldcomputers.net/linus.html" target="_blank">Linus Write-Top</A>, a large tablet computer released in 1987. Five years later, Apple released the ancestor of its iPhone in the shape of Newton, a handheld computer manufactured by the Japanese Sharp Corporation. Operated by a pen-like stylus, it featured pioneering but somewhat erratic handwriting recognition but was never a commercial success. Touchscreen input and handwriting recognition also featured in the Palm series of PDAs (personal digital assistants), which were hugely popular in the mid-1990s.</P>

<P>From iPhones and iPads to ebooks and tablets, all modern touchscreen gadgets owe something to these pioneering inventors and their scribbling machines!</P>
