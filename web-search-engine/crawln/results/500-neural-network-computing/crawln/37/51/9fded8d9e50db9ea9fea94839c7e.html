<P>Explain that Stuff is a fun and friendly guide to the science that powers the world around
us. Although it's mainly designed for informal self-learning, it can
also be used to <B>support formal teaching and home-schooling across the physical science curriculum</B>
for ages ranging from about 10 upward. It can be used by motivated
students working independently, teachers planning classes and devising
activities, and home-schooling parents working in partnership with 
children. This guide is designed to help you get the most from our site
by showing how our articles map to a typical science curriculum.</P>

<H2>How to use this guide</H2>

<P>There are many different science curricula in use around the world, and it's impossible to
detail how a large website like this (with over 450 long articles) maps to all of them.
Instead, I'm going to work through one typical curriculum document,
highlighting the topic areas we help to cover and noting the relevant articles from our site
that support the curriculum in each case. I've chosen to use the <a href="uksciencecurriculum1999.pdf" target="_blank">English National Curriculum for Science</A> [PDF]. Don't worry that it's a UK document; it's clearly written and works well as a simple framework.</P>

<P>Please note that this website is not meant to be an educational textbook, so it doesn't slavishly follow the curriculum,
ticking off each subject in turn; some areas (physical sciences&mdash;and
physics in particular) are very well covered (because that happens to
be my specialism), while others (such as life and earth sciences) are
intentionally not covered at all. Please also be aware that there are <a href="azindex.html">many more
articles</A> on the website that cover fascinating topics you won't find on most
public school curricula (such as <a href="articles_computers.html">computing</A>,
<a href="articles_electricity.html">electronics</A>,
and the <a href="timeline.html">history of technology</A> and
<a href="inventors-and-inventions.html">inventions</A>). If you're a parent supporting
your child at school or a home-schooler, be guided by the curriculum
but don't be overly constrained&mdash;and certainly explore beyond it if your
students show interest.</P>

<H2>How you can use our articles for teaching and learning</H2>

<P>Although some of our articles are strongly geared
to recognizable scientific topics like <a href="light.html">light</A>,
<a href="energy.html">energy</A>, or <a href="magnetism.html">magnetism</A>,
many of them introduce science "by the back door"&mdash;taking a
familiar everyday object and carefully explaining how it works.
One of the big complaints children have about science is that they
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2700145/Children-losing-interest-in-science-through-their-education-report-claims.html
" target="_blank">don't see its relevance to everyday life</A>; our articles help
to address this using copious, familiar examples that package science
in a friendly, relevant, and engaging way. </P>

<P>Teachers have been using our articles in many
different ways. Some simply recommend articles as initial preparation
or follow-up background reading for a deeper class activity or study.
Others suggest students pick a favorite topic from a list of articles
and write a short summary in their own words; that's a good way of
making sure information is properly absorbed and digested.
Another possibility is to ask pupils if they can figure out
how an object or an appliance works, then show them the real
explanation in the appropriate article. Or you could challenge them
to invent the proverbial "better mousetrap": ask them to list the pros and cons of one of their favorite
gadgets or inventions and then see if they can come up with something better.</P>

<P>If you're a home-schooling parent following a
curriculum, one good approach is to look at the articles that support
a particular topic area and work through one or two of them with your
child. For example, if you're home-schooling a 12 year-old and
studying electromagnetism, you could ask your child to make a list of
gadgets and appliances around your home that use electricity and
magnetism. Once that's done, pick one very familiar appliance&mdash;maybe
a <A HREF="loudspeakers.html">loudspeaker</A>,
an <A HREF="how-electric-doorbells-work.html">electric doorbell</A>,
or an <A HREF="electricguitars.html">electric guitar</A>&mdash;and study it together. Read
the article on our website, discuss what's going on inside the
appliance, and relate it to the one you have in your own home.</P>


<H2>Which grade levels we support</H2>

<P>The Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_stage" target="_blank">Educational stage</A> is a
good overview of the different grade levels in different
countries and how they map to one another. Broadly speaking, this
website supports curriculum learning for ages 11&ndash;18 (US grades 6&ndash;12,
UK keystages 3&ndash;5), though bright pupils below age 11 will be able to
tackle some of the simpler articles (and most articles will be of
interest to adult readers too). Our <a href="azindex.html">A-Z index</A> of articles has a
simple traffic-light color-code rating showing articles that are
simple to read, ones of average difficulty, and a handful of more difficult
pieces.</P>

<a name="keystage2"></a>
<H2>Ages 7&ndash;11: Keystage 2, grades 2&ndash;6</H2>

<P>Although our articles are not really written for children under the age of about 10, bright young students could certainly
tackle some of the simpler ones&mdash;and, of course, there's no reason why parents and children shouldn't read and work through
things together. If you're helping a younger child with homework or home study, you could read the articles we've recommended as a
backgrounder for <I>yourself</I> and then explain the key concepts in simpler terms your child can understand.</P>

<H3>1. Life processes and living things</H3>


<H4>Living things in their environment</H4>
<H5>Protecting living things and their environment</H5>

<P>For this age group, concrete examples of environmental problems and solutions work better than abstract ideas.
So you'll find it easier to work with familiar topics like pollution and recycling than with more abstract ideas like
<a href="introduction-to-environmentalism.html">environmentalism</A>, which can be discussed with older students.</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="air-pollution-introduction.html">Air pollution</A>: An overview of air pollution's causes and effects.</LI>

<li><a href="pasteurization.html">Pasteurization</a>: A simple, illustrated explanation of how a pasteurizer works and a brief biography of Louis Pasteur.</li>
</UL>


<H3>2. Materials and their properties</H3>

<P>There are numerous articles on our site exploring
all sorts of simple materials (wood, metals, glass, plastics), as
well as not-so-simple ones (alloys, composites, and self-healing
materials). For younger age groups, the emphasis should be on
recognizing different materials, understanding the similarities and
differences between them, and appreciating that the properties of
different materials make them suitable for different uses.</P>

<H4>Grouping and classifying materials</H4>
<H5>Basic materials</H5>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="glass.html">Glass</A>: The basic manufacture and uses of glass.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="introduction-to-metals.html">Metals</A>: Introduces the difference between metals and nonmetals and links to our detailed articles covering everyday metals.</LI>

<li><a href="rubber.html">Rubber</a>: Includes a discussion of how vulcanization makes rubber more useful.</li>
<LI><A HREF="wood.html">Wood</A>: Explains how we grow, harvest, and use wood.</LI>
</UL>
<H5>Other interesting types of materials</H5>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="ceramics.html">Ceramics</A>: Introduces ceramics and their hugely diverse everyday applications.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="composites.html">Composites and laminates</A>: Although the concept of "composite" presented in this article is too complex for younger children, you could certainly explore the idea of combining materials in simple ways to make stronger ones. For example, most children of this age will come across things like papier mach&eacute;, which is essentially a composite based on paper,
textiles (sometimes), and <a href="adhesives.html">adhesive</A>. Most of us also learn how to strengthen things like book covers with self-adhesive plastic, which is an example of making a laminate.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="protectivematerials.html">Protective materials</A>: Another way to teach materials science is to start from spectacular or dramatic applications and work back to the materials that make them possible. "What sort of clothes would we need to protect us against fire? What might you need to wear for a trip into space?"&mdash;those are options you could explore.</LI>
</UL>
<H5>Properties of materials</H5>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="materials-science.html">Materials science</A>: An introduction to the idea that the inner structure of a material gives it unique properties that make it suitable for a particular job. This is another complex topic, but you can gear it to almost any age group. For example, it's easy to break apart something like a twig and show how the layers of wood give it more strength in one direction than another.
In another simple activity, you could get students to measure the temperature of different materials then see
how hot or cold they feel; explain that materials at the same temperature can feel hotter or colder because of
different rates of heat conduction related to their internal structure.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="states-of-matter.html">States of matter</A>: How a material can change form (state) when the temperature or pressure changes.</LI>

<LI><A HREF="how-clothes-tumble-dryers-work.html">Clothes dryers</A>: Ordinary states-of-matter science can be dull, so why not teach it by exploring the science of drying clothes by evaporation? There's plenty of scope for practical experiments drying clothes in different ways (for example, weighing wet clothes and timing how long they take to dry under different conditions).</LI>
<LI><A HREF="thermometers.html">Thermometers</A>: You can measure temperatures by observing the way
<a href="heat.html">heat energy</A> makes materials expand or contract in thermometers.</LI>
</UL>
<H4>Separating mixtures of materials</H4>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="howwaterfilterswork.html">Water filters</A>: Explains how various water filters separate out impurities. (This article touches on things like ion exchange and osmosis that are too complex for this age group, but the basic idea of water filtering is a good, familiar everyday application and something you can easily demonstrate at home or in class. For younger students, concentrate on simpler, physical filtration with sieves or filter paper.)</LI>
</UL>
<H3>3. Physical processes</H3>

<P>This is our first simple introduction to physics: electricity, light, sound, and basic forces. For this age
group, it's good to keep things concrete and practical. Focus on safe
hands-on experiments with electricity (simple practical electric
circuits with lamps and batteries), magnetism, light, and sound;
there are plenty of examples of things around the home that use all
four. Make sure that you relate forces to easy-to-understand ideas
like weight and falling (don't get bogged down in abstract ideas of
what forces are or how they "act at a distance").</P>

<H3>1. Life processes and living things</H3>

<H4>Living things in their environment</H4>

<P>We learn that humans and the environment are interdependent, how the environment can be protected, and the
importance of sustainable development. For this age group, we can start to explore different types of pollution and touch on some of

other ways)?</P>

<H2>Ages 14&ndash;16: Keystage 4, grades 9&ndash;10</H2>

<P>This is a much more challenging age group: students
at this level study the same broad areas of science but in somewhat
greater depth, taking a more quantitative, critical approach, and
questioning the limits of science. It's particularly important that
we take more trouble to explain to older students why science is relevant
and worth their time. Surveys in the UK show that almost half of nine year-olds
enjoy science because they think it will be useful in life, while only 35
percent of 14-year-olds share that view. Keep things engaging
using plenty of familiar, everyday examples!</P>


<H3>1. Life processes and living things</H3>

<H4>Living things in their environment</H4>

<P>While younger students may have a fairly
black-and-white view of environmental issues (pollution is always
bad, recycling is always good), older students can explore the gray
areas too. Why has pollution happened and could it ever be
justified if it led to economic gains that helped to reduce
poverty or improve health? Does pollution affect different social
groups disproportionately? Is sustainable development an achievable
goal?</P>

<UL>
<LI>Pollution: It's worth comparing air, land, and water pollution instead of tackling just one of them. You could
consider the different ranges of each and note that air pollution is more of a transboundary problem than 
water or land pollution. You could also explore connections such as how air pollution becomes land or water
pollution through atmospheric deposition.</P>

simply polarize the debate and reinforce existing opinions.</LI>

<H3>2. Materials and their properties</H3>

<P>Younger students learn that different materials have
different properties; older students can begin to relate these
properties to the inner structure of different materials. Materials
science is very easy to present in a dull way, so choose interesting and dramatic examples (superglue,

<LI><A HREF="zeolites.html">Zeolites</A>: Catalysts are often taught in a very abstract way that's hard to relate to. As an alternative, why not talk specifically about zeolites?

<H4>Reactions involving enzymes</H4>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="detergents.html">Detergents</A>: This article explains the basic cleaning action of detergents, but also touches on the enzymes found in washing detergents and what they do. One way to frame a lesson around detergents is to explore the label on a typical packet or bottle of clothes washing detergent. Try to choose one carefully with a minimum of complex-sounding ingredients; gloss over any ingredients that don't seem obviously relevant. (Eco-friendly products might be good ones to go for, since they minimize the number of active ingredients.)</LI>
</UL>

<H3>4. Physical processes</H3>

<P>This section extends the same basic physics topics
we've covered for younger age groups. School physics textbooks have a
tendency to run through a list of abstract-sounding areas (forces,
energy, motion, waves...) that may have no apparent relevance to
everyday life, so try to tackle the material in a familiar, everyday
context. For example, you can teach quite a lot of the basic physics
of waves by talking about surfing; sport (including swimming) is a
great way to introduce forces and motion; and there are plenty of
everyday examples of things like static electricity (photocopiers,
laser printers, and power station pollution scrubbers). Remember:
students of this age are questioning the relevance of studying science to
their lives, so keep it concrete, engaging, and interesting!</P>

<H4>Electricity</H4>

<H5>Circuits</H5>

<P>Students of this age are starting to explore more complex circuits and will need to
understand the distinction between basic electricity (a simple source of energy)
and electronics (a way of controlling electricity).

<a name="older"></a>
<H2>Older students (ages 16&ndash;adult)</H2>

<P>For older students, the curriculum becomes richer, deeper, and more diverse and there's a
greater emphasis on critical thought and self-study. Older students 
will begin to encounter interdisciplinary sciences like <a href="introduction-to-psychology.html">psychology</a>,
which combine widely different aspects of the earlier curriculum.</P>
<P>
From the feedback I get from high school (A-level) students, it's pretty clear
that students of this age have reached the stage where they can pick
and choose articles that are most relevant to the topics they want to
study, and I'm not going to offer specific recommendations. One area
where older students like to use our articles is for background reading
in preparation for things like science, engineering, and inventing
contests. For example, if you're going to develop some kind of gadget
that uses trip switches, you could learn how they work in our
background articles about reed switches or Hall-effect sensors before
setting out on your own experiments.</P>
