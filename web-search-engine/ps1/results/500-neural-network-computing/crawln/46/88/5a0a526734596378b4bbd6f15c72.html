<p itemprop="articleBody"><span class="dropcap">N</span>o-one can get it right all the time&mdash;not even the great Bill Gates. Back in
2004, he made an infamously rash prediction that: "Two years from
now, spam will be solved." Some years down the line and guess what, billions of
spam emails are still bouncing round the <a href="internet.html">Internet</A> each day; some
guesstimates suggest up to 97 percent of all email is junk! Most of
us accept "unsolicited commercial email" (the more formal name
for spam or junk email) as the price we pay for global
interconnectivity and all the other good things the Internet can
bring. But do we really have to pay a price at all? Take some
sensible precautions and you can substantially reduce the risk of
spam ever becoming a problem.</P>


<p><span class="credit">Photo: An email address makes it easy for people to contact
you from all over the world&mdash;including spammers!

<h2>Assume your email address <U>will</U> be compromised</h2>

<P>
It's best to face up to this fact from the start: sooner or later,
your much-loved email address is likely to find its way into the
hands of the spammers, those irritating people determined to send you
advertisements for drugs or
<a href="http://j-walk.com/other/conf/" target="_blank">doubtful emails about Nigerian generals</A>
who died in train wrecks. If you're setting up a brand new address,
accept this from the outset and plan accordingly. You can take
sensible precautions to stop your address from being compromised, but
do be prepared to change address again in future if needs be.</P>

<h2>Use multiple addresses for different purposes</h2>

<P>Some people set up two or more email addresses that they use in
different ways, typically one address for business and another for
personal use. You could also set up one or more "disposable"
email addresses for <a href="ecommerce.html">online shopping</A>. I have one shopping address that
I use for utilities, service providers, and companies I shop from all the
time&mdash;people I know and trust not to sell my address on to others.
But I also have a second, more disposable shopping address for
one-off purchases from vendors I may use only once. If that address
becomes compromised, I can easily disable it and set up another one.
If you own your own web domain, you should be able to set up multiple
email aliases (sometimes called forwarders), which look just like
separate email addresses but effectively just redirect any mails to
another address of your choosing. Learn how to set up and delete
email aliases and you can create disposable addresses as often
as you need to.</P>


<P><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/junk-email.jpg" class="irightno" alt="Junk email icon." height="235" width="200"></P>


<h2>Make good use of your spam filters</h2>

<P>You may not have realized this, but the majority of good, honest,
decent Internet service providers are the ones who suffer most from spam. You  think you
have it bad, but their hideously expensive email servers are
cluttered up and slowed down by literally millions of junk emails
they'd rather never see in the first place. If those emails are
addressed to legitimate users, there's little or nothing ISPs can do
about them&mdash;except wait for them to be downloaded and deleted.
</P>

<P>Some ISPs do take a more proactive approach, however. They run
every incoming email through filtering software that quickly scans
it and tries to guess (using what's called <B>Bayesian filtering</B>) whether it's spam or
not. Emails may also be checked to see if the sending domain (or its IP address) is listed
on what's called a <B>real-time blacklist (RBL)</B>&mdash;a list of known spammers.
If a mail is identified as spam, it's flagged as such: it will have an extra line added to
its header recording its likely status or "spam score."</P>

<P>If your ISP is helpfully flagging spam this way, you can
easily set your own email program to look for those spam headers and
weed out any emails containing them. Some ISPs allow you to block or
redirect any emails that look like spam at their mail servers (before
you download them, in other words), which may or may not be a good
idea depending on how critical your mails are likely to be. If you're
plagued with a really serious spam overload, ask your ISP whether
they have spam filtering software installed on their servers and how
you can take advantage of it. They don't always draw attention to it,
and some ISPs actually charge you for using spam filtering.</P>


<h2>Set junk mail filters on your email program</h2>

<P>You can also filter out spam in your email program after you've
downloaded it. The best email programs (such as <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">Mozilla Thunderbird</A>)
contain sophisticated filters that gradually learn to recognize spam
emails and redirect them into a separate spam folder. You can help
them filter more accurately by clicking on the "junk" button when
you see that an email is spam (or on the "not junk" button when
legitimate email has been classified incorrectly as spam). Even if they don't have this
feature, most email programs let you add manual filter rules of your
own. So if your ISP is adding spam flags to email headers, it's
relatively easy to add an email filter rule that checks the headers
for spam status and files them accordingly:
<span class="pre">If spam status header
contains "SPAM", redirect to "JUNK FOLDER"</span>&mdash;that kind of
thing. It's a lot simpler than it sounds!</P>

<P>If your email program doesn't have its own spam filters, you might be able to use an add-on
filter such as <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/" target="_blank">SpamAssassin</A>.</P>

<P class="center"><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/thunderbird-thinks-junk.gif" alt="Classifying junk email with Mozilla Thunderbird." height="54" width="454"></P>


<P><span class="credit">Photo: Mozilla Thunderbird will try to guess which messages are junk. You can help to train it by correcting it when it gets things wrong.
</span></P>

<h2>Use your email program in "secure" mode</h2>

<P>Sometimes spammers work by <span class="italic">guessing</span> your email address and
then trying to prove that it's active. If you receive a spam email,
merely opening it up can be enough to confirm that your address is
active, even if you don't reply. That's because HTML-formatted emails
can contain tiny invisible images (known as tracking pixels) that
automatically link back to the spammer's server. You can minimize the
risk of confirming your identity by setting your email program so it
never sends return receipts (confirmation messages that go back to an
email sender when you open their mail), sends and receives all emails
in plain text, and doesn't display images or attachments "inline"
(open them up by default). If you're really keen on security, switch
your email program to offline mode before opening anything that
looks like spam.</P>

<h2>Consider using disposable, web-based email</H2>

<P>You can set up an email address with Yahoo Mail, Outlook/Live Mail
(formerly Hotmail), Google's Gmail, and other online email providers
in a couple of minutes. Most of these services have very
sophisticated built-in spam filters so all the hassle of handling
spam is done for you. If you have a cherished personal or business
address, save that for your valued contacts&mdash;and consider having a
web-based email address you can easily change for shopping,
submitting comments to website message boards, and everything else
you do online that matters less to you.</P>

<h2>Ignore spam&mdash;don't respond</h2>

<P>Spammers think it's ok to send you mail if they include removal
instructions at the bottom, but it's well known that some spammers
use those "click here to remove" links to confirm that your email
address is alive and ready to receive even more spam! Unless an email
comes from a company you really trust, removal instructions are best
ignored. The golden rule about spam is never to acknowledge or
respond to it in any way.</P>

<h2>Use RSS instead of joining email lists</h2>

<P>Until a few years ago, signing up to a website's email list or
newsletter was the best (and indeed, often the only) way of keeping
in touch with a site you wanted to follow. But the minute you click
"subscribe" or "join list," you could be signing up to a
deluge of unwanted mail (even if it isn't, strictly speaking, spam).
Worse, you could be adding your name to a list that's sold on to
another company or used for other purposes. Why would you want to do
that? Since the introduction of a wonderful web technology called
RSS, you no longer have to sign up to email lists. Many websites now
publish RSS feeds&mdash;effectively little news headlines about themselves
or things that interest them. Sign up to a site's RSS feed and you
can follow it instantly and anonymously without sharing your email
address (you can unsubscribe at any time too).
(Using sites like Facebook and Twitter to follow people,
organizations, and companies is another way to stay abreast of things
without signing up for an email deluge.)</P>

<h2>Consider using a third-party payment service</h2>

<P>Every time you buy something online, you have to register with a
company and submit all kinds of private or confidential information
you'd probably rather not share. If you open an account with a
third-party payment service, such as Google Wallet
(formerly called Google Checkout) or PayPal, you
can limit what you're sharing very effectively. When you pay by
Google Wallet, for example, Google acts as an intermediary,
handling all the payments on your behalf, and you can opt not to
share your email address with the shop you're buying from if you wish:
everything will be channeled to you through Google instead. If you
pay for things using PayPal, you can avoid sharing your credit card
details with shops you've never encountered before and might not
automatically trust. Using services like these can help you reduce
how much information you're sharing online, lessen the risk of
identity theft, and cut problems like spam.</P>

<BR>
<span class="credit">Photos: Using payment services such as Google Wallet (left) and PayPal (right) can help you ensure your private information stays that way&mdash;reducing problems like identity theft and spam.</span></P>


<h2>Watch out for your website</h2>

<P>If you're in business, your website is your online shop
window&mdash;and having an email address where people can contact you is
pretty much obligatory. But posting an email address with an at (@)
sign on a web page is an open invitation to spammers: separate
studies by the Federal Trade Commission and the Center for Democracy
and Technology suggest anything from 86-97 percent of addresses
posted on web pages will eventually attract spam. Since these
addresses are typically harvested automatically by computer programs,
the simplest way to tackle the problem is to write your email address
in a way that makes sense to people but not computers, maybe by
writing the words out in full ("Send emails to <span class="pre">freddysmith at
blahblahblah dot whatever</span>") or by posting your email address
written in an image file (beware that blind or visually impaired
people won't be able to read that and include alternative contact
details for them). You could also try a brilliant little service called
<a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/" target="_blank">reCAPTCHA Mailhide</A>
to disguise your address from spam-harvesting computer
programs. Or, instead of a simple contact email address, you could use a contact form
with anti-spam protection (on this website, we now use <a href="http://www.fastsecurecontactform.com/" target="_blank">Fast Secure
Contact Form</A> written by Mike Challis).</P>

<P>Spammers are far from stupid and <span class="italic">guessing</span> email addresses
is something they're good at. If they have a list of domain names,
they sometimes try to mail likely addresses at those domains (so you
might get speculative emails to info@, sales@, postmaster@ and so on). The best
way of tackling this is to use non-obvious addresses. Instead of
having a general contact email address info@, as we all used to,
choose anything else instead: maybe generalenquiries@ or info123@ or
whatever you like. Another thing spammers seem to do is guess the first
part of an address from the second part. So if your domain is
johndoe.com, don't be surprised if you get unsolicited spam emails
addressed to things like "john@johndoe.com"; maybe pick a
non-guessable address to start with?</P>

<P>When you set up a website, you're obliged to register details of
ownership on a giant global database called WHOIS, which includes one
or more contact email addresses for each domain. Most ISPs now give
you the option to select "domain privacy" when you order domains
(which is a good excuse for charging you more money just to keep your
details hidden from public view). A cheaper and simpler alternative
is either to have your ISP listed as the technical and administrative
contact or to use a disposable email address specifically for WHOIS.</P>

<h2>Don't worry, be happy</h2>

<P>In the end, spam is junk, pure and simple. Don't get worked up about it and don't let it upset you.
Remember that most of it is send by computers that don't have emotions; don't let these mere
machines spoil your day! Take sensible precautions and spam won't be a problem. Don't let the spammers get you down!</P>
