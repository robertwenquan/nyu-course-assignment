<h2>What is a model?</h2>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/model-boat.jpg" class="irightno" alt="A wooden model of a yacht." height="225" width="300"></p>

<P>Have you noticed how children love playing with models? From dolls houses and
cuddly dogs to model <a href="howplaneswork.html">airplanes</a> and race cars, many of the toys
children like most are actually simplified versions of things we find
in the world around us. Are kids wasting their time playing with
toys like this? Far from it! Monkeying around with a model helps you learn how the
world works. Build a model suspension <a href="bridges.html">bridge</A> and&mdash;whether you realize
it or not&mdash;you're learning an awful lot about the science of forces
and the practicalities of everyday engineering. In theory, you can
test whether a new bridge design would work by building a model with
an erector set and loading it up with toy cars. That's why NASA
scientists build models of <a href="spacerockets.html">rockets</A> and space planes and test them
out in <a href="windtunnel.html">wind tunnels</A>.</P>

<p><span class="credit">Photo: This is a little wooden model of a real-life sailboat, but you can see that it's hugely simplified. In theory, you could put it in the bathtub and use it to study <a href="how-ships-work.html">how sailboats work</A> by
blowing on it (using your breath to model the wind). But if you try to do that, you'll find it capsizes straight away. That's
because the sails aren't hung realistically and, unlike on a real boat, there is no keel (underwater stabilizing bar) to keep the vessel upright. A model like this is too crudely simplified to use for scientific studies of real boats&mdash;but it looks neat on my bookshelf!</span></p>

<!-- google_ad_section_end -->

<H3>How is a mathematical model different?</H3>

<P>There are lots of things we need to understand that we can't build out of
miniature <a href="plastics.html">plastic</A> parts. You can't make a model of the weather that
way or predict whether a disease epidemic will spread more in a hot
summer or a cold winter. Things like this have to be modeled
mathematically. A <span class="bold">mathematical model</span> is an abstract way of
understanding very complex things like the weather or the world
economic system. It's a collection of algebraic equations (things
like a+b=2c&divide;d&times;e) that relate different quantities called <span class="bold">variables</span>
(represented here by the letters a, b, c, d, and e). In the case of weather forecasting, the variables are things like air pressure, air temperature, humidity, ocean temperature, wind speed,
and so on and they're related by equations based on the laws of
physics. In theory, if you've measured some of these things, you can
figure out the others by solving the equations; and if you've
measured the things many times in the past and know how they relate
to one another, you can attempt to predict what will happen in the
future. That's mathematical modeling in a nutshell!</P>

<H3>Why use a computer for mathematical modeling?</H3>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/geothermal-computer-model.jpg" class="ileftno" alt="A researcher builds a computer model of  geothermal energy production on the screen of a Silicon Graphics workstation." height="274" width="350"></p>

<p><span class="credit">Photo: What if...? An energy researcher studies a computer model of geothermal energy on a workstation screen. Photo by David Parsons courtesy of
<a href="http://images.nrel.gov/" target="_blank">US Department of Energy/National Renewable Energy Laboratory (US DOE/NREL)</A>.</span></p>

<P>You don't necessarily need a <a href="howcomputerswork.html">computer</a> to
make a mathematical model. Pick an easy enough problem and you can do the math in your head or draw
yourself a little chart on paper. Let's look at a really simple
example. Suppose you're 10 years old and you want to know how tall
you're going to be when you're 20. You could guess you're going to be
twice as tall (because you'll be twice as old), but if you've done a
lot of growing early on and you're tall for your age, that's going to
give you the wrong answer. If you've grown at a steady rate (so many
centimeters/inches per year), you could guess that your height at
some age in the future (let's call it X) is your height at age 10
(call that A) plus the number of years into the future (call that B)
times the number of centimeters you grow per year (call that C). So X
= A + (B &times; C). If you're 150cm (1.5m or ~5 ft) tall at age 10 and
grow an average of 5cm (~ 2 inches) per year for each of the next 10
years, you'll be 150 + (10 x 5) = 200cm (6.5 ft) tall at age 20. That
sounds like a fair guess (if a little on the high side)&mdash;and it certainly sounds better than
just doubling your height at age 10 (which predicts a height of 3m or 10ft by age 20). </P>

<P>A model of something like the weather involves hundreds, thousands, or even
millions of different variables linked together by much more complex
equations. There are so many variables and so many equations that it
would take forever to solve them by hand. When pioneering
mathematical modeler Lewis Fry Richardson made one of the world's
first detailed weather forecasts this way in the 1920s, using just
seven equations, it took him and his wife something like six weeks to
figure out a single day's weather! That's why, in practice,
<a href="how-supercomputers-work.html">supercomputers</a> (ultra-powerful computers) are now used for
virtually all mathematical modeling&mdash;and why it's now called
computer modeling as a result. Let's face it, no-one wants to wait
six weeks to hear what the weather was like a couple of months ago!</P>

<h2>How do you build a computer model?</h2>

<P>The first step in building a model is to decide which variables it should
include and figure out the equations that connect them together. This
involves making a number of <span class="bold">assumptions</span> and <span class="bold">simplifications</span>.
Going back to our model of height at age 20, you can see we made two
notable assumptions: first, that we'd keep growing at all and second
that we'd do so at a steady rate between 10 and 20. What if we'd
stopped growing at 11 or grown much more rapidly at ages 14 and 15?
We could have allowed for that with a more complex equation if we'd
wanted to. Another thing we didn't consider was whether our model
ceased to be valid at all after a certain age (do the numbers and
you'll find it predicts we'll be 3.5m or ~11.5 ft tall at the age of
50 and 6m or ~20ft tall if we reach 100). There were all kinds of things we
might have considered or incorporated into our height model&mdash;but we
glossed over them to keep the problem simple to understand and easy
to solve.</P>

<P>Models are <span class="italic">always</span> (by definition) simplified versions of real life and, where
mathematical models are concerned, there are good reasons for this.
If really complex problems (such as weather forecasting and
<a href="globalwarmingforkids.html">climate change</a>) are being studied, mathematical models have to be simplified
purely so that computers can generate useful results in a reasonable
amount of time. The science of modeling is all about ensuring that the
variables and equations in a model represent reality as accurately as
possible, but there's an art to modeling too&mdash;and that involves
deciding what kind of simplifications can safely be made without
making the model so crude that any results it produces are inaccurate
or misleading. Early 1970s models of the climate neglected clouds,
for example, which were considered too complex and changeable to
represent accurately. Once computers became more powerful, climate
models were extended to include the way clouds behave, hopefully
producing much more accurate and useful weather forecasts and climate
simulations in the process.</P>

<P><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/climateprediction.jpg" class="irightno" alt="An example of a model of climate change from climate prediction.net" height="233" width="299"></P>

<p><span class="credit">Photo: Climate models are based on millions of precise measurements of the weather
made all over the world during the last few decades. My computer produced this computer model of the climate
as part of <a href="http://www.climateprediction.net/" target="_blank">Climateprediction.net</a>,
in which ordinary computer users help scientists study global warming. Over 47,000 computers in
the world are helping to "number crunch" climate data for the project.</span></p>


<P>Once the model is built, it has to be loaded up with data; in the case of a
climate model, that means real-world measurements of the different
variables, such as temperature, rainfall, and pressure measurements
from around the world going back years or decades. Once that's done,
it's possible to <span class="bold">verify</span> and <span class="bold">validate</span> the model.
Verifying a model means running it to see whether it makes reasonable
predictions. So if you build a model for weather forecasting and it
tells you the temperature in Beijing next week is going to be 5000
degrees, you know you've gone wrong somewhere. Validating a model is
a different process that involves running a model to produce results
you can check against existing data. So if you build a model of the world's weather using
measurements taken during every year of the 20th century (from 1900
to 1999), you might run it forward to the years 2002, 2003, and 2004
(say) to see what predictions it makes. You could compare those
predictions with actual measurements made during those years and, if
there's good agreement, take that as a validation of the model.</P>

<P>With the model successfully built, verified, and validated, the next step is
to use it to make some actual <span class="bold">predictions</span>. A weather
forecasting model could be used to predict how much rain will fall in
Toronto or Berlin for a week or two in advance; a climate model
(similar in many ways and based on the same data) would be making far
less detailed predictions much further into the future. 
</P>

<h2>What else are computer models used for?</h2>


<P>Modeling the weather and climate aren't the only things you can do with
computer modeling. Models are used in all kinds of fields from
science and engineering to medicine and economics. A model of a newly
designed <a href="howplaneswork.html">airplane</a> might be used to predict the stresses and
<a href="straingauge.html">strains</a>
on different parts of the fuselage at different flying speeds or
under different flying conditions (in strong winds, with ice on the
wings, or whatever the conditions might be). Military planners often
run computer simulations ("wargames") to consider how potential
battles might play out with different numbers of tanks, troops, and
airplanes. Traffic planners can make models of the highway network
(or the streets in a busy city) to test whether new signals or road
layouts will make cars run more smoothly. When dramatic
accidents occur in space, scientists run models to test the best ways
of making repairs or to figure out whether astronauts can return home
safely. In all these cases, the modelers can try out many different
possibilities and find what works best&mdash;without ever leaving their
desk!</P>

<h2>Why use computer models?</h2>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/argonne-nuclear-reactor-computer-model.jpg" class="ileftno" alt="A computer model of fluid flow in a nuclear reactor produced by Argonne National Laboratory." height="300" width="300"></p>

<P>This illustrates perhaps the most important advantage of computer
modeling: it gives us the ability to ask "what if?" questions
about complex aspects of the world we can't easily test in reality.
You can't build 100 different designs of skyscraper to see which is
most likely to survive an <a href="earthquakes.html">earthquake</a>, but you can do that very easily
with a computer model. You can't run a war in four different ways to
see which option gives the fewest civilian casualties, but a computer
model can give you a pretty good idea. If the problem you're trying
to tackle is something like <a href="globalwarmingforkids.html">climate change</a>, and you want to know what
will happen centuries into the future, computer models are the only
tools at your disposal.</P>

<P>Modeling also saves time and money. Auto manufacturers routinely test the
safety of their cars by wrecking prototypes (test versions) with
crash-test dummies inside them, but it saves a great deal of
time and money to do a lot of pre-testing with computer models
beforehand. Computer models make it possible to run many more tests
and cars are safer as a result. Computer models are increasingly
being used to predict natural disasters, such as hurricanes,
earthquakes, and tsunamis. If weather forecasters can accurately
predict which tropical storms will become hurricanes, and how they
will behave when they hit land, they can warn people of danger in
good time, helping to reduce damage to property and potentially save
lives.</P>

<P>Next time you fool around with a model, bear this in mind: you're not <span class="italic">playing</span>,
your carrying out serious scientific research!</P>


<h2>Who invented computer models?</h2>
<P>Here's a brief list of some key moments in modeling:</P>
<UL>
<LI>1920s: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Fry_Richardson" target="_blank">Lewis Fry Richardson</A> begins modeling weather using seven mathematical equations, but has no computers to help him .</LI>
<LI>1940s: US mathematician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann" target="_blank">John von Neumann</a> pioneers the use of computers in modeling</LI>
<LI>1950: An early supercomputer called <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/about-seas/eniac/" target="_blank">ENIAC</a> makes the world's first computerized weather forecast.</LI>
<LI>1960: The <a href="http://ncar.ucar.edu/" target="_blank">National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)</a> is established in Boulder, Colorado to study weather and climate with complex computer models.</LI>
<LI>1972: Meteorologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz" target="_blank">Edwin Lorenz</a> sums up the complex, uncertain, nature of weather forecasting by asking his famous question "Does the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?". Attempts to answer the question lead to popular interest in a new branch of math known as chaos theory.</LI>
<LI>1972: A group of academics and others known as <a href="http://www.clubofrome.org/" target="_blank">The Club of Rome</A> runs a computer model of how the planet's resources are being used and concludes human civilization will collapse.</LI>
<LI>1980s: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet" target="_blank">Spreadsheets</A> (computer programs that calculate and draw charts from lists of numbers entered into tables) are developed for inexpensive PCs, so virtually anyone can build and run simple computer models. Spreadsheets soon revolutionize business planning.</LI>
<LI>1990s: The <a href="internet.html">Internet</a> makes it possible for millions of ordinary PC users to
help scientists run large, complex computer models by downloading
chunks of data and processing them during "downtime." SETI@Home and
FightAIDS@Home are two of the best known projects of this kind.</LI>
<LI>2003: Climate scientists launch <a href="http://www.climateprediction.net/" target="_blank">Climateprediction.net</a>, allowing millions of computer users
worldwide to help run a giant model of the climate.</LI>
