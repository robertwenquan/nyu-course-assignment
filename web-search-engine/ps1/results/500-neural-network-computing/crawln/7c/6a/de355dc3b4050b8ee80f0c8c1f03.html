<h3>Text</h3>

<P><span class="bold">All the text on Explain that Stuff is copyright &copy; Chris Woodford (with copyright dates as indicated on each page) and all rights are reserved. Unauthorized use of text from this website on other websites (and elsewhere) is an infringement of copyright under international laws that apply in most countries</span>,
including Title 17 of the United States Code USC <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html" target="_blank">section 501</a>, et seq. (including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act), the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/contents" target="_blank">Copyright Designs and Patents Act (1988)</a> in the UK, the
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0028/index.html" target="_blank">Copyright &amp; Related Rights Act 2000 (Ireland)</A>, and copyright laws that apply in most other countries through the Berne Convention and other international treaties. All text from this website is registered (or deposited pending registration) at the US Copyright Office, so under section 504(c)(2), willful copyright infringement could make you liable to statutory damages of up to $150,000 per work infringed. You may browse and download information from this website for your own personal use. You are not permitted to copy, broadcast, download, upload, store (in any medium), transmit, translate, distribute, show or play in public, adapt or change in any way the text of Explainthatstuff.com web pages for any other purpose whatsoever without the prior written permission of the copyright owner (Chris Woodford).</P>

<P><a href="http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter9/index.html" target="_blank">Fair use</A> (also known as "fair dealing"), such as <span class="italic">briefly</span> quoting from articles on this website for purposes of commentary or discussion, is fine, but you <span class="bold">must</span> attribute this website as the source (in some legal jurisdictions, this is referred to as giving "sufficient acknowledgement") and not pass off our work as your own.</P>
<P>
If you are teacher or professional educator, you are <I>most welcome</I> to print and circulate copies of our articles as handouts or other teaching materials for classes <I>within your own school</I>. You do not need to ask permission, but please kindly credit this website as your source. We consider this a fair use&mdash;and something we would warmly endorse and encourage. However, please kindly do not copy articles verbatim onto publicly accessible school or educational websites. These create inferior substitutes for the original articles (copies are not regularly checked, improved, and updated) and we will consider them copyright infringement.</P>

<P>Under Title 17 of the United States Code USC <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#506" target="_blank">section 506</A> and <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap12.html#1202" target="_blank">section 1202</A>, <span class="bold">it can be a criminal offence to intentionally remove copyright management information (CMI), including copyright notices and copyright ownership information, from copyright works</span>. If you copy articles from this website and remove the copyright notice, or paste a copyright notice of your own onto something you have copied from this website, you could be committing a criminal offence. The penalty for doing this for commercial advantage or private financial gain can be a fine of up to $500,000 or imprisonment for up to five years. So don't do it!</P>
