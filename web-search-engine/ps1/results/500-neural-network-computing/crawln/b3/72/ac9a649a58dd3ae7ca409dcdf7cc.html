<p>We take privacy issues seriously&mdash;and yes everyone says that, but we <span class="italic">really</span> do. Here (in plain English) are full details explaining the careful steps we have taken to respect and protect your privacy as you use our website.</P>

<LI>We do not routinely use analytical cookies to produce statistical reports about users. We use web server statistics instead.</LI>
<LI>We do not use sharing widgets, which place (third-party) cookies on your computer and track your web browsing. We use our own simple sharing links instead, which operate like ordinary web links, do not track you, and do not compromise your privacy.</LI>
<LI>Our site is completely free to use and has to run advertising or it wouldn't exist, but 
we run the minimum amount of advertising that we possibly can and keep it as unobtrusive

<P>Please read on if you'd like a fuller explanation&mdash;and for details of how to <a href="#remove">remove unwanted cookies</A> from your computer.</P>
</div>


<div class="main2">
<h2>What are cookies?</h2>

<P>When you look at websites, text, graphics, videos, and other computer data moves from a web server (which stores the website you're looking at and "serves" it up to you) to your web browser (the program, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, or whatever you use to surf the Web). There is no easy way for a web browser to remember things about you as you move from page to page, which makes life difficult if you want to do something like putting a product in a shopping cart (trolley), select a particular size of text for the pages you're looking at, sign in to a website for a personalized experience, and so on.</P>

<P>That's where <span class="bold">cookies</span> come in. Cookies are small files that websites can store on your computer to help them remember things about you. Some cookies (known as <span class="bold">session cookies</span>) stay on your computer only for very short periods of time (typically, until you close your browser); others, known as <span class="bold">persistent cookies</span>, may stay there for years. Some cookies, known as <span class="bold">first-party cookies</span>, are set by the websites you visit; others are set by services that those websites rely on (for example, advertisements, statistical tracking programs, social networking widgets and so on)&mdash;and they're known as <span class="bold">third-party cookies</span>. Cookies like this can be used to track a web user's progress as they move from one website to another, although they generally do so anonymously (they don't usually contain personally identifiable information). Nevertheless, the use of cookies does raise understandable concerns about privacy. If you are worried about this, you can set up your web browser to accept or reject certain kinds of cookies and you can inspect or delete the cookies it contains at any time. We explain how to do this below.</P>

<h2>How do we use cookies?</h2>

<P>We use cookies for two things: to improve your experience of our site and to serve relevant personalized advertising.</P>

<h3>Improving your experience of our site</h3>
<p>
Our website uses only one persistent (long-lasting) cookie (called
COOKIECONSENT_DISMISSED): to record the fact that you have seen our cookie warning and consented to it by clicking "Got it." This cookie is stored for one year from the time when you give your consent. Our website doesn't use any other "persistent" (long-lasting) cookies and doesn't use any cookies to track you or collect personal information about you.</p>

<p>Although we do not generally use persistent cookies, our server will usually store one or two <I>temporary</I> (session) cookies on your computer. These expire at the end of your session (when you close your browser):</P>
<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/phpsessid-cookie.png" class="iright" alt="Typical contents of the PHPSESSID cookie and when it expires." height="318" width="446"></p>

<UL>
<LI>Depending on which pages you're looking at, the server may store a simple cookie called PHPSESSID on your computer purely for the duration of your session. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_ID">PHPSESSID</A> is a technical mechanism that helps the server ensure you can browse our site efficiently when there are multiple people viewing the site at the same time.
It's essentially a random string of letters and numbers that the server assigns to you so it can remember you, as you hop from page to page, and not mix up your session with other people's.
This is purely an internal server mechanism: we don't use this cookie to track you in any way whatsoever
and it will expire and be deleted from your computer as soon as you close your web browser.</LI>
<LI>Our site is hosted on a high-performance cloud grid, using many servers. It may store a temporary cookie called DYNSRV, which helps the load balancer (a mechanism that spreads the load evenly across all the servers) to figure out and remember which server is sending pages to you&mdash;so the site is served to you faster.</LI>
</UL>

<P><span class="credit">Photo: The typical contents of a PHPSESSID cookie: a simple random identifier (yellow). The cookie expires at the end of your session (red), which usually means when you close your browser.</span></P>


<P><B>None of these cookies (COOKIECONSENT_DISMISSED, PHPSESSID, or DYNSRV) collect or store any personal information about you or track your behavior for marketing purposes in any way whatsoever</B>.</P>

<h3>Serving relevant, personalized advertising</h3>

<p>Although our own server does not set persistent cookies (other than for cookie consent), please be aware
that <B>some persistent third-party cookies are set when you visit our website</B>. Our site runs advertisements on most pages; it is a completely free website and if it didn't run advertising, it would simply not exist. The advertising partners we work with use what are known as persistent, third-party cookies to help them serve up relevant, targeted advertisements that they believe may match your interests. Our partners assure us that these cookies are anonymous and do not use personally identifying information to serve advertisements to you unless you have specifically given permission for that. (Although you might raise an eyebrow at this use of cookies, we believe it is better that advertisers show you things you might find interesting or useful than completely random advertisements.) We have no control over these third-party cookies. We do not see or have access to any information they may store or collect. They pass directly between your computer and the servers run by our advertisers.</P>

<P>At the moment, we run advertisements only through Google.</P>

<P>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads to you based on your prior visits to our website.
Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to our site and/or other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting
<a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/" target="_new">Google's Ads Settings</A> page. Alternatively, you can opt out by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_new">aboutads.info</A>.
The cookies of other third-party vendors or ad networks may also be used to serve ads on our site
and you can usually opt out of these cookies too by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_new">aboutads.info</A>. You can learn more about how Google safeguards your privacy by visiting <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a> website.</P>

<h2>Social networking sites</h2>
<P>
Like pages on most other modern websites, most of the pages on our site now include links to social networking and bookmarking sites (including the Facebook Like button, Google +1 button, and Twitter Tweet button) to help people remember our articles and share them with their friends. Please be aware that, depending on how you are signed into these services, they might be using cookies to track websites or pages you visit. <span class="bold">No such information is collected by our own site and none of the information that may be collected by social networking sites is available to us</span>: it passes directly between your computer and the social networking site(s) you belong to. 
If you have concerns about privacy and social networking bookmarks, please visit the privacy pages of the sites or services you use:</P>

<h2>UK Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003</h2>

<P>
European Law requires that we inform European citizens of how our website uses cookies. 
We have carefully reviewed our legal obligations under the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/2426/contents/made" target="_blank">Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003</A> (revised May 2011), in line 
with guidance from the UK 
<a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/cookies-and-similar-technologies/" target="_blank">Information Commissioner's Office</a>. It's for this reason that our site informs you that it is using cookies when you first enter it.</P>


<h2>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

<P>As explained above, this site collects and stores no personal information from anyone&mdash;and that includes children under the age of 13. We believe it is therefore fully compliant with the US <a href="http://www.coppa.org/" target="_blank">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</a>.</P>

<h2>Opting out</h2>

<P> We don't offer a way for you to opt-out of having your information collected or a way to remove your personal information from our records&#8212;simply because we don't collect any information about you!</P>

</div>


<div class="box">
<a name="remove"><h2>How can you control your privacy?</h2>

<P>Remember: <span class="bold">you</span> are in control: you can restrict the information that websites collect about you
very easily at any time.</P>

<p>
If you're concerned about cookies, you can change the options in your Web browser to restrict how websites can use them. You can switch off certain cookies, instruct your browser to keep them only for certain periods, or delete cookies altogether. You can set the
level of privacy controls you want by looking under Privacy in your browser's options, preferences, or settings:</P>
<UL>
<LI><span class="bold">Internet Explorer</span> (recent versions): Click on the gear icon on the top right. Look under Internet options &gt; Privacy. Use the slider to control cookies and set the level of privacy you prefer.</LI>
<LI><span class="bold">Internet Explorer</span> (older versions): Click on Tools. Look under Internet options &gt; Privacy. Use the slider to control cookies and set the level of privacy you prefer.</LI>
<LI><span class="bold">Firefox</span>: Look under Tools &gt; Preferences &gt; Privacy. (On some versions of Firefox, you'll need to look under Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Privacy.)</LI>
<LI><span class="bold">Chrome and Chromium</span>: Click on the spanner on the top right of your screen. Then look under Preferences &gt; Under the Hood &gt; Privacy &gt; Content Settings &gt; Cookies.</LI>
<LI><span class="bold">Safari (Macintosh)</span>: Click on the gear icon on the top right. Then look under Preferences &gt; Privacy.</LI>
<LI><span class="bold">Safari (iPhone and iPod Touch)</span>: Click on Settings (the gear icon) from the iPhone/iPod Home screen. Privacy is near the top. You can either use Private Browsing to stop your browser remembering anything at all or selectively control cookies under the heading "Accept Cookies."</LI>
<LI><span class="bold">Konqueror (Linux)</span>: Click on Settings &gt; Configure Konqueror &gt; Cookies &gt; Policy.</LI>
</UL>

<P>For other browsers, look up "Privacy" or "Cookies" in the user guide.</P>

<P>Please be aware that if you switch off cookies altogether, you <span class="italic">might</span> prevent some parts of some websites (such as shopping carts and personal preferences) from working properly or you might find yourself logged out of a website and unable to access it properly. One solution is to enable cookies only for those websites you know and trust (favorite shopping sites) and disable them for all other sites. Generally, if you don't log in to websites and you don't want to buy things or set website preferences, it is safe to switch off cookies altogether; if any websites do need to use them, they will usually display a message suggesting you switch them back on.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/firefox-dont-track.png" class="iright" alt="How to set the don't track option in the Firefox browser." height="240" width="400"></p>

<h3>Don't track, private browsing, and incognito</h3>

<P>Some modern Web browsers have other ways of improving your privacy. For example, if you look under "Privacy" in newer versions of Firefox, you'll find a simple tick-box option "Tell websites I do not want to be tracked." Sounds great! Unfortunately, as the privacy-friendly search engine DuckDuckGo has <a href="http://www.whatisdnt.com/" target="_blank">pointed out</a>, "do not track" is an empty promise: it's entirely voluntary (and it doesn't stop tracking anyway), so it's much less effective than blocking or deleting cookies. Most of the common browsers also have a "private browsing" or "incognito" mode that stops any data from being collected as you move from page to page, but you probably won't be able to sign into websites if you use this option all the time. And you won't be completely incognito: your IP address will still be visible to and logged by any sites you visit.</P>

<P><span class="credit">Photo: You'll find the "Don't Track" option in Firefox under the Privacy options. You can also change the "History" setting underneath so Firefox deletes all records of your current session when you exit your browser.</span></P>
</div>

<div class="main2">
<h2>Site statistics and server logs</h2>

<P>Unlike many other websites, we don't obsessively run analytics software to track our visitors; occasionally
we run Google Analytics for a few days to help us diagnose technical problems, but we don't have it switched
on the whole time tracking everything you do. Instead, through our website hosting company, we run a general statistical package called <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">AWStats</a> to show up daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly patterns and trends. It doesn't log any personal information about you or how you use our site: it simply tells us general things about how many visitors we have, which pages they look at, and so on. Except when there are technical issues, we don't retain web server logs or the detailed information they contain, so the way you use our site is not tracked or traced.</p>

<h2>How can you find out more about privacy issues?</h2>

You might also find Simson Garfinkel's book
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Mji4KPEqV3AC" target="_blank">Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century</A>
interesting; though it's a little dated on specifics now, the basic issues haven't changed.</P>
