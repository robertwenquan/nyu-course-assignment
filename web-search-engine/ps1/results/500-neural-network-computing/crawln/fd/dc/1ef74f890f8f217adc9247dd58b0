In recent years, the term has often been applied to computer-based operations specifically.</p><!--[END-1ST-PARA]--><p>In popular usage, the term <em><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/information-communications"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/287834/information">information</span></a></em> refers to facts and opinions provided and received during the course of daily life: one obtains information directly from other living beings, from <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/mass-media"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/368234/mass-media">mass media</span></a>, from electronic <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/data-computing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/152149/data">data</span></a> banks, and from all sorts of observable phenomena in the surrounding environment. A person using such facts and opinions generates more information, some of which is communicated to others during discourse, by instructions, in letters and documents, and through other media. Information organized according to some logical relationships is referred to as a body of knowledge, to be acquired by systematic <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/exposure-photography"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/198703/exposure">exposure</span></a> or study. Application of knowledge (or skills) yields expertise, and additional analytic or experiential insights are said to constitute instances of wisdom. Use of the term <em>information</em> is not restricted exclusively to its communication via natural language. Information is also registered and communicated through art and by facial expressions and gestures or by such other physical responses as shivering. Moreover, every living entity is endowed with information in the form of a genetic code. These information phenomena permeate the physical and mental world, and their variety is such that it has defied so far all attempts at a unified definition of information.</p><!--[MEDIA-STRIP]--><p>Interest in information phenomena increased dramatically in the 20th century, and today they are the objects of study in a number of disciplines, including philosophy, physics, biology, linguistics, information and <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/computer"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/130429/computer">computer</span></a> science, electronic and communications <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/engineering"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/187549/engineering">engineering</span></a>, management science, and the social sciences. On the commercial side, the information service <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/industry"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/287256/industry">industry</span></a> has become one of the newer industries worldwide. Almost all other industries—manufacturing and service—are increasingly concerned with information and its handling. The different, though often overlapping, viewpoints and phenomena of these fields lead to different (and sometimes conflicting) concepts and “definitions” of information.</p><p>This article touches on such concepts as they relate to information <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/processing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/477744/processing">processing</span></a>.

Signs are the irreducible elements of communication and the carriers of meaning. The American philosopher, mathematician, and physicist <a name="ref212009" id="ref212009"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/biography/Charles-Sanders-Peirce"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/448884/Charles-Sanders-Peirce">Charles S. Peirce</span></a> is credited with having pointed out the three dimensions of signs, which are concerned with, respectively, the body or medium of the sign, the object that the sign designates, and the interpretant or interpretation of the sign. Peirce recognized that the fundamental relations of information are essentially triadic; in contrast, all relations of the physical sciences are reducible to dyadic (binary) relations. Another American philosopher, <a name="ref212010" id="ref212010"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/biography/Charles-William-Morris"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/392865/Charles-William-Morris">Charles W. Morris</span></a>, designated these three sign dimensions syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic, the names by which they are known today.</p><p>Information processes are executed by information processors. For a given <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/information-processor"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/287874/information-processor">information processor</span></a>, whether physical or biological, a <a name="ref212011" id="ref212011"></a>token is an object, devoid of meaning, that the processor recognizes as being totally different from other tokens. A group of such unique tokens recognized by a processor constitutes its basic “alphabet”; for example, the dot, dash, and space constitute the basic token alphabet of a Morse-code processor. Objects that carry meaning are represented by patterns of tokens called <a name="ref212012" id="ref212012"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/symbol"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/577703/symbol">symbols</span></a>. The latter combine to form symbolic expressions that constitute inputs to or outputs from information processes and are stored in the processor memory.</p><p><a name="ref212013" id="ref212013"></a>Information processors are components of an <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/information-system"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/287895/information-system">information system</span></a>, which is a class of constructs. An <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/abstract-document"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/1944/abstract">abstract</span></a> model of an information system features four basic elements: processor, memory, <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/receptor-information-processing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/493434/receptor">receptor</span></a>, and <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/effector-information-processing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/179985/effector">effector</span></a> (<a href="/topic/information-processing/images-videos/2009" class="media-overlay-link" data-id="2009" data-type="image">Figure 1</a>). The processor has several functions: (1) to carry out elementary information processes on symbolic expressions, (2) to store temporarily in the processor’s short-term memory the <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/input-computing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/288868/input">input</span></a> and <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/output-computing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/435666/output">output</span></a> expressions on which these processes operate and that they generate, (3) to schedule execution of these processes, and (4) to change this <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/sequence-programming"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/1086517/sequence">sequence</span></a> of operations in accordance with the contents of the short-term memory.

The two other components, the <a name="ref212015" id="ref212015"></a>receptor and the <a name="ref212016" id="ref212016"></a>effector, are input and output mechanisms whose functions are, respectively, to receive symbolic expressions or stimuli from the external environment for manipulation by the processor and to emit the processed structures back to the environment.</p><p>The <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/science/power-physics"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/473289/power">power</span></a> of this abstract model of an information-processing system is provided by the ability of its component processors to carry out a small number of elementary information processes: reading; comparing; creating, modifying, and naming; copying; storing; and writing. The model, which is representative of a broad variety of such systems, has been found useful to explicate man-made information systems implemented on sequential information processors.</p><p>Because it has been recognized that in nature information processes are not strictly sequential, increasing attention has been focused since 1980 on the study of the human brain as an information processor of the parallel type.

On the one hand, it is considered an economic resource, somewhat on par with other resources such as labour, <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/material"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/369000/material">material</span></a>, and capital. This view stems from evidence that the possession, manipulation, and use of information can increase the cost-effectiveness of many physical and cognitive processes. The rise in information-processing activities in industrial <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/manufacturing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/849534/manufacturing">manufacturing</span></a> as well as in human problem solving has been remarkable.

By 1975 these activities accounted for half of the labour force of the United States, giving rise to the so-called <a name="ref212024" id="ref212024"></a>information society.</p><div class="bps-topic-table-wrapper"><div class="bps-topic-table" id="toc9116021">

Unlike other resources, information is expansive, with limits apparently imposed only by time and human cognitive capabilities. Its expansiveness is attributable to the following: (1) it is naturally diffusive, (2) it reproduces rather than being consumed through use, and (3) it can be shared only, not exchanged in transactions. At the same time, information is compressible, both syntactically and semantically. Coupled with its ability to be substituted for other economic resources, its transportability at very high speeds, and its ability to impart advantages to the holder of information, these characteristics are at the base of such societal industries as research, education, publishing, marketing, and even politics. Societal concern with the husbanding of information resources has extended from the traditional domain of libraries and <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/archives"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/33033/archives">archives</span></a> to encompass organizational, institutional, and governmental information under the umbrella of information resource management.</p><p>The second perception of information is that it is an economic commodity, which helps to stimulate the worldwide growth of a new <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/segment-computer-memory"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/532656/segment">segment</span></a> of national economies—the information service sector. Taking advantage of the properties of information and <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/building"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/83834/building">building</span></a> on the perception of its individual and societal utility and value, this sector provides a broad range of information products and services. By 1992 the market share of the U.S. information service sector had grown to about $25 billion. This was equivalent to about one-seventh of the country’s computer market, which, in turn, represented roughly 40 percent of the global market in computers in that year. However, the probable convergence of computers and television (which constitutes a market share 100 times larger than computers) and its impact on information services, entertainment, and education are likely to restructure the respective market shares of the information industry.</p></section></section><section class="eb-topic-section" data-level="1" id="toc61652"><h2 class="h2"><span>Elements of information processing</span></h2><p>Humans receive information with their <a name="ref212025" id="ref212025"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/science/senses"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/534691/senses">senses</span></a>: sounds through hearing; images and <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/text-media"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/589385/text">text</span></a> through sight; shape, temperature, and affection through touch; and odours through smell. To interpret the signals received from the senses, humans have developed and learned complex systems of languages consisting of “alphabets” of symbols and stimuli and the associated rules of usage. This has enabled them to recognize the objects they see, understand the messages they read or hear, and comprehend the signs received through the tactile and olfactory senses.</p><p>The carriers of information-conveying signs received by the senses are energy phenomena—audio waves, light waves, and chemical and electrochemical stimuli. In engineering parlance, humans are receptors of analog signals; and, by a somewhat loose convention, the messages conveyed via these carriers are called analog-form information, or simply <a name="ref212026" id="ref212026"></a>analog information. Until the development of the <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/digital-computer"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/163278/digital-computer">digital computer</span></a>, cognitive information was stored and processed only in analog form, basically through the technologies of <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/printing-publishing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/477017/printing">printing</span></a>, photography, and telephony.</p><p>Although humans are adept at processing information stored in their memories, analog information stored external to the mind is not processed easily. Modern information <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/technology"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/585418/technology">technology</span></a> greatly facilitates the manipulation of externally stored information as a result of its representation as digital signals—i.e., as the presence or absence of energy (electricity, light, or magnetism). Information represented digitally in two-state, or <a name="ref212027" id="ref212027"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/bit-communications"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/67148/bit">binary</span></a>, form is often referred to as <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/digital-information"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/163310/digital-information">digital information</span></a>. Modern information systems are characterized by extensive metamorphoses of analog and digital information. With respect to information <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/storage-computing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/567495/storage">storage</span></a> and communication, the transition from analog to digital information is so pervasive as to bring a historic transformation of the manner in which humans create, access, and use information.</p><section class="eb-topic-section" data-level="2" id="toc61653"><h2 class="h3"><span>Acquisition and recording of information in analog form</span></h2><p>The principal categories of information sources useful in modern information systems are text, video, and voice. One of the first ways in which prehistoric humans communicated was by <a name="ref212030" id="ref212030"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/science/sound-physics"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/555255/sound">sound</span></a>; sounds represented concepts such as pleasure, anger, and fear, as well as objects of the surrounding environment, including food and tools. Sounds assumed their meaning by convention—namely, by the use to which they were consistently put. Combining parts of sound allowed representation of more complex concepts and gradually led to the development of speech and eventually to spoken “natural” languages.</p><p>For information to be communicated broadly, it needs to be stored external to human memory; because accumulation of human experience, knowledge, and learning would be severely limited without such storage, the development of <a name="ref212031" id="ref212031"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/writing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/649670/writing">writing</span></a> systems was made necessary.</p><p>Civilization can be traced to the time when humans began to associate abstract shapes with concepts and with the sounds of speech that represented them. Early recorded representations were those of visually perceived objects and events, as, for example, the animals and activities depicted in Paleolithic cave drawings. The evolution of writing systems proceeded through the early development of <a name="ref212032" id="ref212032"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/pictography"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/459568/pictography">pictographic</span></a> languages, in which a symbol would represent an entire concept. Such symbols would go through many metamorphoses of shape in which the resemblance between each symbol and the object it stood for gradually disappeared, but its semantic meaning would become more precise. As the conceptual world of humans became larger, the symbols, called <a name="ref212033" id="ref212033"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/ideogram"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/281922/ideogram">ideographs</span></a>, grew in number. Modern Chinese, a present-day result of this evolutionary direction of a pictographic writing system, has upwards of 50,000 ideographs.</p><p>At some point in the evolution of written languages, the method of representation shifted from the pictographic to the phonetic: speech sounds began to be represented by an <a name="ref212034" id="ref212034"></a>alphabet of graphic symbols. Combinations of a relatively small set of such symbols could stand for more complex concepts as words, phrases, and sentences. The <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/invention-technology"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/292272/invention">invention</span></a> of the written phonetic alphabet is thought to have taken place during the 2nd millennium <span class="bps-small-text">bc</span>. The pragmatic advantages of alphabetic writing systems over the pictographic became apparent twice in the past millennium: after the invention of the movable-type <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/printing-press"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/477067/printing-press">printing press</span></a> in the 15th century and again with the development of information processing by electronic means since the mid-1940s.</p><p>From the time early humans learned to represent concepts symbolically, they used whatever materials were readily available in nature for recording.

From the 7th century on, paper became the dominant writing material of the Islamic world. Papermaking finally reached Spain and Sicily in the 12th century, and it took another three centuries before it was practiced in Germany.</p><p>With the invention of <a name="ref212042" id="ref212042"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/printing-publishing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/477017/printing">printing</span></a> from <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/movable-type"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/395178/movable-type">movable type</span></a>, <a name="ref212043" id="ref212043"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/typesetting"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/611740/typesetting">typesetting</span></a> became the standard method of creating copy.

The mechanical typewriter finally found wide use after World War I. Today its electronic variant, the computer video terminal, is used pervasively to <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/record-computing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/493773/record">record</span></a> original text.</p><p>Recording of original nontextual (image) information was a manual process until the development of <a name="ref212046" id="ref212046"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/technology-of-photography"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/457963/technology-of-photography">photography</span></a> during the early decades of the 19th century; drawing and carving were the principal early means of recording graphics. Other techniques were developed alongside printing—for example, etching in stone and metal. The invention of <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/film-photography"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/206935/film">film</span></a> and the photographic process added a new dimension to information acquisition: for the first time, complex visual images of the real world could be captured accurately. Photography provided a method of storing information in less space and more accurately than was previously possible with narrative information.</p><p>During the 20th century, versatile electromagnetic media opened up new possibilities for capturing original analog information. <a name="ref730115" id="ref730115"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/magnetic-tape"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/357320/magnetic-tape">Magnetic audio tape</span></a> is used to capture speech and music, and magnetic <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/videotape"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/1521365/videotape">videotape</span></a> provides a low-cost medium for recording analog voice and video signals directly and simultaneously. Magnetic technology has other uses in the direct recording of analog information, including alphanumerics. Magnetic characters, bar codes, and special marks are printed on checks, labels, and forms for subsequent sensing by magnetic or optical readers and conversion to digital form. Banks, educational institutions, and the retail industry rely heavily on this technology. Nonetheless, paper and film continue to be the dominant media for direct storage of textual and visual information in analog form.</p></section><section class="eb-topic-section" data-level="2" id="toc61654"><h2 class="h3"><span>Acquisition and recording of information in digital form</span></h2><p>The versatility of modern information systems stems from their ability to represent information electronically as digital signals and to manipulate it automatically at exceedingly high speeds. Information is stored in <a name="ref212048" id="ref212048"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/bit-communications"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/67148/bit">binary</span></a> devices, which are the basic components of <a name="ref730175" id="ref730175"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/digital-information"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/163310/digital-information">digital</span></a> technology. Because these devices exist only in one of two states, information is represented in them either as the absence or the presence of energy (electric pulse). The two states of binary devices are conveniently designated by the binary digits, or bits, zero (0) and one (1).</p><p>In this manner, alphabetic symbols of natural-language writing systems can be represented digitally as combinations of zeros (no pulse) and ones (pulse). Tables of equivalences of alphanumeric characters and strings of binary digits are called <a name="ref212049" id="ref212049"></a>coding systems, the counterpart of writing systems. A combination of three binary digits can represent up to eight such characters; one comprising four digits, up to 16 characters; and so on. The choice of a particular coding system depends on the size of the character set to be represented. The widely used systems are the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (<a name="ref212050" id="ref212050"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/ASCII"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/37933/ASCII">ASCII</span></a>), a seven- or eight-bit code representing the English alphabet, numerals, and certain special characters of the standard computer keyboard; and the corresponding eight-bit <a name="ref212051" id="ref212051"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/EBCDIC"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/198825/EBCDIC">Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code</span></a> (EBCDIC), used for computers produced by IBM (International Business Machines Corp.) and most compatible systems. The digital representation of a character by eight bits is called a <a name="ref212052" id="ref212052"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/byte"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/87112/byte">byte</span></a>.</p><p>The seven-bit ASCII code is capable of representing up to 128 alphanumeric and special characters—sufficient to accommodate the writing systems of many phonetic scripts, including Latin and Cyrillic. Some alphabetic scripts require more than seven bits; for example, the Arabic alphabet, also used in the Urdu and Persian languages, has 28 consonantal characters (as well as a number of vowels and diacritical marks), but each of these may have four shapes, depending on its position in the word.</p><p>For digital representation of nonalphabetic writing systems, even the eight-bit code accommodating 256 characters is inadequate. Some writing systems that use Chinese characters, for example, have more than 50,000 ideographs (the minimal standard <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/font"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/212443/font">font</span></a> for the Hanzi system in Chinese and the kanji system in Japanese has about 7,000 ideographs). Digital representation of such scripts can be accomplished in three ways. One approach is to develop a phonetic character set; the Chinese Pinyin, the Korean Hangul, and the Japanese hiragana phonetic schemes all have alphabetic sets similar in number to the Latin alphabet. As the use of phonetic alphabets in Oriental cultures is not yet widespread, they may be converted to ideographic by means of a dictionary lookup. A second technique is to decompose ideographs into a small number of elementary signs called strokes, the sum of which constitutes a shape-oriented, nonphonetic alphabet. The third approach is to use more than eight bits to encode the large numbers of ideographs; for instance, two bytes can represent uniquely more than 65,000 ideographs. Because the eight-bit ASCII code is inadequate for a number of writing systems, either because they are nonalphabetic or because their phonetic scripts possess large numbers of diacritical marks, the computer industry in 1991 began formulating a new international coding standard based on 16 bits.</p><section class="eb-topic-section" data-level="3" id="toc61655"><h2 class="h4"><span>Recording media</span></h2><p><a href="/topic/information-processing/images-videos/The-challenge-of-preserving-digital-information-2009-film/198702" class="bps-assembly-container media-overlay-link" data-id="198702" data-type="video" data-ytrk="77"><span class="md-assembly-content"><img alt="preserving digital information [Credit: Contunico © ZDF Enterprises GmbH, Mainz]" src="http://media-3.web.britannica.com/eb-media/37/179437-049-BEAA504D.jpg" width="426" height="240"><i class="fa fa-play-circle-o fa-3x"></i><span class="md-assembly-thumb-caption"><span class="md-assembly-thumb-title">preserving digital information</span><span class="md-assembly-thumb-credit">Contunico © ZDF Enterprises GmbH, Mainz</span></span></span></a><a name="ref212053" id="ref212053"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/punched-card"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/483451/punched-card">Punched cards</span></a> and perforated paper tape were once widely used to store data in binary form.

Video recording tape has been adapted for digital storage, and <a name="ref212057" id="ref212057"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/digital-audio-tape"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/163266/digital-audio-tape">digital audio tape</span></a> (DAT) surpasses all tape storage devices in offering the highest areal data densities. DAT technology uses a helical-scan recording method in which both the tape and the recording head move simultaneously, which allows extremely high recording densities. Early four-millimetre DAT cassettes had a capacity of up to eight billion bytes (eight gigabytes).</p><p>Another type of magnetic storage medium, the <a name="ref212058" id="ref212058"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/magnetic-disk"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/357041/magnetic-disk">magnetic disk</span></a>, provides rapid, random access to data. This device, developed in 1962, consists of either an aluminum or a plastic platen coated with a metallic material. Information is recorded on a disk by turning the charge of the read-write head on and off, which produces magnetic “dots” representing binary digits in circular tracks. A block of data on a given track can be accessed without having to pass over a large portion of its contents sequentially, as in the case of tape. Data-retrieval time is thus reduced dramatically. <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/hard-disk"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/1521171/hard-disk">Hard disk</span></a> drives built into personal computers and workstations have storage capacities of up to several gigabytes.

When such a catalog is represented digitally in a computer, any attribute can serve as the ordering key. By sorting the catalog on different keys, it is possible to produce a variety of indexes as well as subject bibliographies. More important, any of the attributes of a computerized catalog becomes a search key (access point) to the collection, surpassing the utility of the traditional card catalog.</p><p>The most useful access key to analog-form items is subject.

It consists of extracting from the item or assigning to it subject and other “descriptors”—words or phrases denoting significant concepts (topics, names) that occur in or characterize the content of the record. Indexing frequently accompanies abstracting, a technique for condensing the full text of a document into a short summary that contains its main ideas (but invariably incurs an information loss and often introduces a bias). Computer-printed, indexed abstracting journals provide a means of keeping users informed of primary information sources.</p></section><section class="eb-topic-section" data-level="3" id="toc61662"><h2 class="h4"><span>Description and content analysis of digital-form information</span></h2><p>The description of an electronic document generally follows the principles of bibliographic cataloging if the document is part of a database that is expected to be accessed directly and individually.

The document description must include the name of the database server—i.e., its physical location. Because database servers may delete particular documents, the description must also contain a <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/pointer-computing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/466421/pointer">pointer</span></a> to the document’s logical address (the generating organization). In contrast to their usefulness in the descriptive cataloging of analog documents, physical attributes such as format and size are highly variable in the milieu of electronic documents and therefore are meaningless in a universal document-naming scheme. On the other hand, the data type of the document (text, sound, etc.) is critical to its transmission and use. Perhaps the most challenging design is the “living document”—a constantly changing pastiche consisting of sections electronically copied from different documents, interspersed with original narrative or graphics or voice comments contributed by persons in distant locations, whose different versions reside on different servers.

Used earlier for the generation of concordances in literary analysis and other computer applications in the humanities, full-text indexing placed great demands on computer storage because the resulting index is at least as large as the body of the text. With decreasing cost of mass storage, automatic full-text indexing capability has been incorporated routinely into state-of-the-art information-management software.</p><p>Text indexing may be supplemented by other syntactic techniques so as to increase its precision or robustness.

The general approach has been that of computational linguistics: to derive representations of the syntactic and semantic relations between the linguistic elements of sentences and larger parts of the document. Syntactic relations are described by <a name="ref212115" id="ref212115"></a>parsing (decomposing) the grammar of sentences (<a href="/topic/information-processing/images-videos/2010" class="media-overlay-link" data-id="2010" data-type="image">Figure 3</a>).

In “scripts,” events and actions rather than objects are defined in terms of their attributes.</p><p>Indexing and linguistic analyses of text generate a relatively gross measure of the semantic relationship, or subject similarity, of documents in a given collection. Subject similarity is, however, a pragmatic phenomenon that varies with the observer and the circumstances of an observation (purpose, time, and so forth). A technique experimented with briefly in the mid-1960s, which assigned to each document one or more “roles” (functions) and one or more “links” (pointers to other documents having the same or a similar role), showed potential for a pragmatic measure of similarity; its use, however, was too unwieldy for the computing environment of the day.

The principal objective of all storage structures is to facilitate the processing of data elements on the basis of their relationships; the structures thus vary with the type of relationship they represent. The choice of a particular storage structure is governed by the relevance of the relationships it allows to be represented to the information-processing requirements of the task or system at hand.</p><p>In information systems whose store consists of unstructured databases of natural-language records, the objective is to retrieve records (or portions thereof) on the basis of the presence in the records of words or short phrases that constitute the query. Since there exists an index as a separate file that provides information about the locations of words and phrases in the database records, the relationships that are of interest (e.g., word adjacency) can be calculated from the index. Consequently, the database text itself can be stored as a simple ordered <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/sequential-file"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/535219/sequential-file">sequential file</span></a> of records.

Its major advantage over the hierarchical and network structures is the ability to handle unanticipated data relationships without pointers. Relational storage structures are two-dimensional tables consisting of rows and columns, much like the conceptual library catalog mentioned above. The elegance of the relational model lies in its conceptual simplicity, the availability of theoretical underpinnings (relational algebra), and the ability of its associated software to handle data relationships without the use of pointers. The relational model was initially used for databases containing highly structured information. In the 1990s it largely replaced the hierarchical and network models, and it also became the model of choice for large-scale information-management applications, both textual and multimedia.</p><p>The feasibility of storing large volumes of full text on an economical medium (the digital optical disc) has renewed interest in the study of storage structures that permit more powerful retrieval and processing techniques to operate on cognitive entities other than words, to facilitate more extensive semantic content and context analysis, and to organize text conceptually into logical units rather than those dictated by printing conventions.</p></section><section class="eb-topic-section" data-level="3" id="toc61668"><h2 class="h4"><span><a name="ref212132" id="ref212132"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/query-language"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/487090/query-language">Query languages</span></a></span></h2><p>The uses of databases are manifold.

In a wide-area information service, a number of which began operating at the beginning of the 1990s on the Internet computer network, a user’s personal computer or terminal (called a <a name="ref212139" id="ref212139"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/client"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/121476/client">client</span></a>) can search simultaneously a number of databases maintained on heterogeneous computers (called <a name="ref212140" id="ref212140"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/server"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/535947/server">servers</span></a>). The latter are located at different geographic sites, and their databases contain different data types and often use incompatible data formats. The simultaneous, distributed search is possible because clients and servers agree on a standard document addressing scheme and adopt a common communications <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/protocol-diplomacy"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/480258/protocol">protocol</span></a> that accommodates all the data types and formats used by the servers. Communication with other wide-area services using different protocols is accomplished by routing through so-called <a name="ref212141" id="ref212141"></a>gateways capable of protocol translation. The architecture of a typical networked information system is illustrated in <a href="/topic/information-processing/images-videos/2015" class="media-overlay-link" data-id="2015" data-type="image">Figure 5</a>. Several representative clients are shown: a “dumb” terminal (i.e., one with no internal processor), a personal computer (PC), a Macintosh (Mac), and a NeXT machine. They have access to data on the servers sharing a common protocol as well as to data provided by services that require protocol conversion via the gateways. Network news is such a wide-area service, containing hundreds of news groups on a variety of subjects, by which users can read and post messages.</p><p>Evolving information-retrieval techniques, exemplified by an experimental interface to the NASA space shuttle reference manual, combine natural language, hyperlinks, and key-word searching. Other techniques, seeking higher levels of retrieval precision and effectiveness, are studied by researchers involved with artificial intelligence and neural networks.

In the first type, images are formed by the print mechanism making contact with the paper through an ink-coated ribbon. The mechanism consists either of print hammers shaped like characters or of a print head containing a row of pins that produce a pattern of dots in the form of characters or other images.</p><p>Most <a name="ref212152" id="ref212152"></a>nonimpact printers form images from a matrix of dots, but they employ different techniques for transferring images to paper.

Digital-to-analog converters are available as inexpensive boards for microcomputers or as software for larger machines. Human speech is the most effective natural form of communication, and so applications of this technology are becoming increasingly popular in situations where there are numerous requests for specific information (e.g., time, travel, and entertainment), where there is a need for repetitive instruction, in electronic <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/voice-mail"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/865028/voice-mail">voice mail</span></a> (the counterpart of electronic text mail), and in toys.</p></section></section><section class="eb-topic-section" data-level="2" id="toc218046"><h2 class="h3"><span>Dissemination of information</span></h2><p>The process of recording information by handwriting was obviously laborious and required the dedication of the likes of Egyptian scribes or monks in monasteries around the world.

Used to produce books as well as cards, charms, and calendars, block printing spread to Korea and Japan but apparently not to the Islamic or European Christian civilizations. European woodcuts and metal engravings date only to the 14th century.</p><p>Printing from movable type was also invented in China (in the mid-11th century <span class="bps-small-text">ad</span>). There and in the bookmaking industry of <a name="ref212164" id="ref212164"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/place/Korea"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/693609/Korea">Korea</span></a>, where the method was applied more extensively during the 15th century, the ideographic type was made initially of baked clay and wood and later of metal. The large number of typefaces required for pictographic text <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/composition-printing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/130157/composition">composition</span></a> continued to handicap printing in the Orient until the present time.</p><p>The invention of character-oriented printing from movable type (1440–50) is attributed to the German printer <a name="ref212165" id="ref212165"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/biography/Johannes-Gutenberg"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/249878/Johannes-Gutenberg">Johannes Gutenberg</span></a>. Within 30 years of his invention, the movable-type printing press was in use throughout Europe. Character-type pieces were metallic and apparently cast from metallic molds; paper and vellum (calfskin parchment) were used to carry the impressions. Gutenberg’s technique of assembling individual letters by hand was employed until 1886, when the German-born American printer Ottmar Mergenthaler developed the <a name="ref212166" id="ref212166"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/Linotype"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/342596/Linotype">Linotype</span></a>, a keyboard-driven device that cast lines of type automatically. Typesetting <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/speed-photography"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/559076/speed">speed</span></a> was further enhanced by the <a name="ref212167" id="ref212167"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/Monotype-typesetting-machine"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/390177/Monotype">Monotype</span></a> technique, in which a perforated paper ribbon, punched from a keyboard, was used to operate a type-casting machine. Mechanical methods of typesetting prevailed until the 1960s. Since that time they have been largely supplanted by the electronic and <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/optical-printing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/430463/optical-printing">optical printing</span></a> techniques described in the previous section.</p><p>Unlike the use of movable type for printing text, early <a name="ref212168" id="ref212168"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/art/graphic-art"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/242020/graphic-art">graphics</span></a> were reproduced from wood relief engravings in which the nonprinting portions of the image were cut away. Musical scores, on the other hand, were reproduced from etched stone plates. At the end of the 18th century, the German printer Aloys Senefelder developed <a name="ref212169" id="ref212169"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/lithography"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/343748/lithography">lithography</span></a>, a planographic technique of transferring images from a specially prepared surface of stone.

The invention of <a name="ref212173" id="ref212173"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/technology-of-photography"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/457963/technology-of-photography">photography</span></a>, aside from providing a new medium for capturing still images and later video in analog form, was significant for two other reasons. First, recorded information (textual and graphic) could be easily reproduced from film, and, second, the image could be enlarged or reduced. Document reproduction from film to film has been relatively unimportant, because both printing and photocopying (see above) are cheaper. The ability to reduce images, however, has led to the development of the <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/microform"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/380395/microform">microform</span></a>, the most economical method of disseminating analog-form information.</p><p>Another technique of considerable commercial importance for the duplication of paper-based information is <a name="ref212174" id="ref212174"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/photocopying-machine"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/457786/photocopying-machine">photocopying</span></a>, or dry photography. Printing is most economical when large numbers of copies are required, but photocopying provides a fast and efficient means of duplicating records in small quantities for personal or local use. Of the several technologies that are in use, the most popular process, xerography, is based on electrostatics.</p><p>While the volume of information issued in the form of printed matter continues unabated, the <a name="ref212175" id="ref212175"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/electronic-publishing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/183863/electronic-publishing">electronic publishing</span></a> industry has begun to disseminate information in digital form. The digital <a name="ref212176" id="ref212176"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/optical-disc"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/430383/optical-disc">optical</span></a> disc (see above <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/information-processing"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/287847/information-processing">Recording media</span></a>) is developing as an increasingly popular means of issuing large bodies of archival information—for example, legislation, court and hospital records, encyclopaedias and other reference works, referral databases, and libraries of computer software. Full-text databases, each containing digital page images of the complete text of some 400 periodicals stored on <a name="ref212177" id="ref212177"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/CD-ROM"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/100922/CD-ROM">CD-ROM</span></a>, entered the market in 1990. The optical disc provides the mass production technology for publication in machine-readable form. It offers the prospect of having large libraries of information available in virtually every school and at many professional workstations.</p><p>The coupling of computers and digital <a name="ref212178" id="ref212178"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/telecommunication"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/585799/telecommunication">telecommunications</span></a> is also changing the modes of information dissemination. High-speed digital satellite communications facilitate electronic printing at remote sites; for example, the world’s major newspapers and magazines transmit electronic page copies to different geographic locations for local printing and distribution. Updates of catalogs, computer software, and archival databases are distributed via e-mail, a method of rapidly forwarding and storing bodies of digital information between remote computers.</p><p>Indeed, a large-scale transformation is taking place in modes of formal as well as informal communication. For more than three centuries, formal communication in the scientific community has relied on the <a name="ref212180" id="ref212180"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/topic/scholarly-journal"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/527958/scholarly-journal">scholarly</span></a> and professional periodical, widely distributed to tens of thousands of libraries and to tens of millions of individual subscribers. In 1992 a major international publisher announced that its journals would gradually be available for computer storage in digital form; and in that same year the State University of New York at Buffalo began building a completely electronic, paperless library. The scholarly article, rather than the journal, is likely to become the basic unit of formal communication in scientific disciplines; digital copies of such an article will be transmitted electronically to subscribers or, more likely, on demand to individuals and organizations who learn of its existence through referral databases and new types of alerting information services. The Internet already offers instantaneous public access to vast resources of noncommercial information stored in computers around the world.</p><p>Similarly, the traditional modes of informal communications—various types of face-to-face encounters such as meetings, conferences, seminars, workshops, and classroom lectures—are being supplemented and in some cases replaced by e-mail, <a name="ref212181" id="ref212181"></a><a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/bulletin-board-system"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/183745/bulletin-board-system-BBS">electronic bulletin boards</span></a> (a technique of <a data-ytrk="/548" href="/technology/broadcasting"><span property="about" href="http://semantic.britannica.com/accepted_headword/core/80543/broadcasting">broadcasting</span></a> newsworthy textual and multimedia messages between computer users), and electronic teleconferencing and distributed problem-solving (a method of linking remote persons in real time by voice-and-image communication and special software called “groupware”). These technologies are forging virtual societal networks—communities of geographically dispersed individuals who have common professional or social interests.</p></section></section></article>

    We welcome suggested improvements to any of our articles.<br/>
    You can make it easier for us to review and, hopefully, publish your contribution by keeping a few points in mind:<br/>
    <ol>
        <li>Encyclopaedia Britannica articles are written in a neutral, objective tone for a general audience.</li>
        <li>You may find it helpful to search within the site to see how similar or related subjects are covered.</li>
        <li>Any text you add should be original, not copied from other sources.</li>
        <li>At the bottom of the article, feel free to list any sources that support your changes, so that we can fully understand their context. (Internet URLs are best.)</li>
    </ol>
    Your contribution may be further edited by our staff, and its publication is subject to our final approval. Unfortunately, our editorial approach may not be able to accommodate all contributions.
