## Planning for the course project

### Project Idea

I would like to work out a self-contained image search engine from scratch.

Due to the time constraint of the course, it will have the following limited functionality:
* food dishes images ONLY
* search food dishes pictures in the picture search engine
* search similar food pictures based on selected picture
* combined search with keywrod and picture similarity

The search engine will have all the basic components of a common text search engine:

* Crawling
 * we will crawl a huge amount of known fruit pictures from
  * web search engines
  * food websites
  * supermarket websites
  * restaurant homepages
  * stock photos
  * social media
  * wikipedia
  * misc

* Indexing
 * indexing labels to images
 * labels not limited to dish name but includes flavor, food type, etc.

* Searching
 * search images based on the labels
 * search imaegs based on visual similarity

* Ranking
 * ranking based on similarity of concept
 * ranking based on visual similarity
