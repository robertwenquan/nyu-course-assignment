## List of words

#### Objective

Use focused crawl method to search an object from web search engines and measure accuracy of the crawl.

#### Method

First launch a seed crawl of this object, and follow the links to extend the crawl.
Measure the naive method, and then apply some known techniques to filter the ads or other stuffs using anchor text and ??? methods to reduce the number of images during the crawl.
Terminute when getting the target number of images. (say 200)?

Ignore the inaccessible links. Only count the fetched images.

Then have a visual inspection and check the accuracy for this target crawl.

#### Use of the data

For the 25 common objects, we will have a target number of pictures(say 200) for each of them. This is a baseline to compare with the improved accuracy after applying the other methods in this paper.
