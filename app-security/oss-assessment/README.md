Choose a reasonably complex open-source project. Preferably one that's not too popular like firefox. Some suggestions are libav, vlc, joomla, suricata, k9mail. You are welcome to choose one that is relevant to your day job. Confirm the selection with me (there will be a dead line for this). Perform application security assessment on the chosen project and produce a report.

During the assessment you will need to custom applications for testing and fuzzing interfaces. Include any of this code as part of the submission. Other guidelines:

* Gain a deep understanding of all security-related aspects of the project
* Determine important/significant attack vectors. How would you approach it if you were a hacker.
* Identify design weaknesses
* Identify security critical functionality, learn the security model
* Determine the ecosystem for the application, where it lives, deployment instances/scenarios.
* Use automated testing techniques
* Hand-review sensitive features, understand the code
* Learn how the application handles user privacy
* Develop improvement guidelines
* Write up bug reports, submit bug reports to the project
* Future work, given more time what would you want to analyze
* Good software engineer development plan, anything missing? i.e unit tests.
* Develop a coding standard or improve upon the existing one.
* You will need to submit this at the end of the course.
