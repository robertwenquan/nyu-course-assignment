/*
 Write a C++ program that reads in a text file ( called data8.txt), and prints the file to the screen the text with all extra blanks removed (that is, if there are 2 or more blanks  in a row, replace them by a single blank)  and changes  ALL  letters to UPPERCASE letters.
 
 WATCH THAT YOU DON'T DELETE CARRIAGE RETURNS and tabs. Whitespace includes tabs and carriage returns as well as blanksâ€¦so you only want to get rid of extra blank characters.
 
 Hint read in 1 char at a time.
 
 As usual call your program HW8.cpp and submit your program via NYU Classes.
 
 Sample input Text:
 
 In    the    late 60s and      early 70s,       PL/I  was       popular, and    was the largest language of its day. The C language was       developed       as a       reaction, where     the language itself is     relatively small, and instead of the hundreds of "built-in" functions of           PL/I,        it      allowed        the user to      choose the subset of functions they wanted to use via #include statements.
 
 Later, C++ was        developed as an extension to C, creating a        language       that was still procedure-oriented via its functions., but with object                constructions                  overlaid on it.  As C++ continued to develop, more                     constructions                   were added ( e.g. templates),                  and existing                   features were redefined .!
