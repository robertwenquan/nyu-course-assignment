In    the    late 60s and      early 70s,       PL/I  was       popular, and    was the largest language of its day. The C language was       developed       as a       reaction, where     the language itself is     relatively small, and instead of the hundreds of "built-in" functions of           PL/I,        it      allowed        the user to      choose the subset of functions they wanted to use via #include statements. 

Later, C++ was        developed as an extension to C, creating a        language       that was still procedure-oriented via its functions., but with object                constructions                  overlaid on it.  As C++ continued to develop, more                     constructions                   were added ( e.g. templates),                  and existing                   features were redefined .!
